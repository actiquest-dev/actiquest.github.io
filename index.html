    </h2>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p><em>Yet, at the dawn of the era of robots, on October 11, 2024, Tesla arranged an incredible presentation called &quot;We, Robot&quot; and presented robotaxis there, along with Optimus robots. When Tesla finished its presentation, a stream showed a number of people communicating with robots on tables and in the crowd. However, the robots greeted with their arms, poured drinks, and danced; that is why some guests felt like they were controlled by real people remotely.</em></p>
<p>Yet, not everybody can afford a $30,000+ robot. In most cases, a robot doesn&#x27;t even need to have a physical body to be able to assist a person in his or her daily routine. It can live in your smartphone and a variety of AR wearable devices and bring no less benefits than Optimus.</p>
<p>In an era where the intersection of AI technologies, Web3 and sports opens up new horizons,<a href="https://actiq.ai/"> Actiquest Lab</a> created a revolutionary application that effectively digitizes sports coaching.</p>

        <span><strong>Problem Statement</strong></span>
    </h2>
</doc-anchor-target>
<ul>
<li><p>The demand for sports training is huge and keeps growing. Sports coaches are expensive (in the US, 1 hour of tennis classes may start from $100) and are also limited by their human nature, to train everyone. Coaches are constantly looking for new ways of monetizing their abilities: releasing video lessons and training athletes remotely.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Increasing demand for personalized training and workouts. The consumers want unique training programs tailored to different personality traits, goals, and lifestyles. Traditional fitness apps offer general program modes that cannot address the individual needs of all users.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Increased demand for home workouts and sports conducted remotely. Such a trend has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, when many people continue to choose to exercise at home or outdoors, avoiding crowded gyms.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Growing interest is taken in sports-derived VR and AR technologies. Immersive training and sports skills training open new opportunities, though high equipment costs and lack of quality content restrain their adoption.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Low motivation of athletes to master new sports. A person is capable of mastering several sports in order for his body to be physically harmonious. In the digital age, this means he has to download several applications, start synchronizing data, find time to study, and much, much more. But a modern multimodal AI agent will be able to methodologically and organizationally solve this problem completely and even motivate such useful interests using web3 rewards.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Web3 users are too poorly engaged in a healthy lifestyle due to excessive time spent on the computer/smartphone and engagement in play2earn casual games. At the moment, the lack of projects connected with sports and an active way of life in the Web3 industry plays a significant role here. The first representatives of these projects are STEPN and Agon, which connect the advantages of Web3 technologies with engagement in physical activities.</p>

D.R.O.C instantly detects errors or incorrect movements and gives the user feedback, helping them improve their technique without the need for repeated workout reviews or consultations with a trainer. That will work like a special RAG over Llama.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Web3 tools for maximizing sport motivation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Incentivization protocol based on $ACTI, a cross-chain cryptocurrency, specifically designed to reward sports achievements across mass adopted ecosystems like Solana, TON, BNB, SKALE, ICP chains.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Decentralized apps for Actiq web3 ecosystem growth:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><p>DAO for managing and decision-making on development of incentivization protocol, $ACTI circulation across several blockchain ecosystems and storage/commercial use of pre-trained models both ViT and Sport Knowledge LLM as a public good owned by the DAO community.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Oracles to decentralize AI training data coming from centralized sources and secure AI model ownership by athletes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cross-Chain Bridges for free $ACTI circulation between ecosystems, mentioned above.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Gamification of the sports experience:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Development of a system of levels, achievements and competitions between users.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create virtual challenges and tournaments to increase engagement.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Continuous learning and adaptation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Using DROC to continuously improve algorithms based on user data</p>
</li>
<li><p>Regular updates to the knowledge base of AI coaches, taking into account the latest research in the field of sports science.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Social aspect:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Creating a community of users for sharing experiences and mutual motivation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Integrate with existing social platforms to expand your reach.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The given solution will revolutionize the concept of sports training and make quality training accessible to all. A blend of AI technologies with the engines of Web3 democratizes access not only to professional training but also creates a new paradigm in the sports industry, where technology becomes one of the key factors for achieving physical excellence and a healthy lifestyle</em>.</p>

<p><strong>The technologies behind Actiquest</strong></p>
<p>Our team has been developing in the field of computer vision for more than 7 years. Early next year, we are launching the release of Actiq, a sports super-app with multimodal AI under the hood. You can train in several sports disciplines using just one app for all sports: tennis, paddle, baseball, golf, track your games, compete, lead an active lifestyle, and even earn money in the application. Beginners who aren&#x27;t sure what they want and what sports they like will find it helpful.</p>
<p>We develop special AI technology for sports, combining GenAI with advanced Vision Transformers, machine learning that processes fitness data from various sources, recognizes health problems, and correctly assesses your capabilities, with generative AI reasoning to implement the emotional and motivational component, and to make sure the communication with you is in your native language.</p>
<p>By investigating limitations of the Video LLM approach of recognizing frames of a scene and reasoning over what happened next, we are in a position to combine real-time multi-threaded vision transformers with our custom distillation and online correction (D.R.O.C) tools in the most effective way to respond to corrections. This is generally a very good process for undergoing athletic training.</p>
<p>D.R.O.C stands for <em>Distilling and Retrieving Generalizable Knowledge</em> <em>via Online Corrections</em>, which essentially enables AI to make real-time decisions regarding the quality of exercise performance and allows adjustments in technique to be made by the athlete. The D.R.O.C. technology instantly recognizes mistakes or wrong movements and gives users feedback that helps them enhance their technique without the need to review workouts or consult with a coach. As such, this not only makes training more efficient but also safer, reducing the chances of injury while accelerating results.</p>
<p>High-accuracy Vision Transformers operating at 60 frames per second enable the analysis of user movements during training. The principle of operation of transformer models called ViT is fully integrated with language models. They divide an image into small areas and process them by attention mechanisms. That allows for the recognition of more complex movements and postures of athletes more effectively.</p>
<p>Among computer vision systems, the ViT technologies are even more resource-efficient than convolutional neural networks:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is beneficial for ViT since it can detect complex sequences of athlete movements; hence, it is helpful in real-time exercise technique improvements, enabling users to provide more correct feedback from an AI coach.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>With ViT, we will be able to recognize even the tiniest details of images for better acknowledgment of fine motor skills and recording deviations from exercise technique. For instance, the slightest deviations in tennis or gymnastics have a negative effect on final results when it comes to competition.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>ViT requires less resource consumption both for training and video processing at the inferencing stage. It would also no longer be necessary to upload a video to the server, and the entire process of interaction between the Athlete and the AI ​​happens in real time. Our AI, in turn, in such a way, can process videos directly on users&#x27; devices and provide a reduction in wait time after the completion of exercises before receiving recommendations.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Also, the user need not worry about sensitive personal data since the video stream is not being transmitted to anywhere; only the anonymized metadata will be transmitted to the Sport Knowledge LLM.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Double impact of innovation</strong></p>
<p>Actiq is an AI-powered application with additional web3-based motivational incentive economics added to it. This has never happened before (Sport Knowledge AI that can incentivize athletes). New users in the sports industry are going to come into crypto space, both coaches and sport lovers.</p>

</ul>
<p>Rather than being coaches who give instructions, AIGC in Actiq become veritable companions in the sports journey of action undertaken by each user. Advanced technology, a personalized approach, a reward system, and friendly interface combine in an environment where training becomes entertaining and motivating. This is a new standard in sport preparation where technology serves to unlock the full potential of every single athlete and make the path to achievement effective and truly exciting.</p>
<p>Opposed to humanoid robots from <em>Will Smith starring Sci-Fi thriller “I Robot”</em>, cat-like AIGC character design could make the whole process of learning and training more fun-less intimidating. Optimus robots, Cybercab robo-taxis, and Robovan buses were completely inspired by this film, which means that the marketing of robotic innovations is surprisingly predictable.</p>
<p>Why a cat? Humanoid robots sometimes fall into an &quot;uncanny valley&quot; where they are almost human but with subtle differences that are disquieting. The virtual cat character avoids this problem in its entirety by taking on a very non-human form that is universally attractive and non-threatening. People have a natural affection for animals, cats especially. This helps, in some cases, to work out a sense of camaraderie and, therefore, motivation to make the workout experience more comfortable.</p>

        <span>***<strong>Can AIGCs coach better than humans?</strong></span>
    </h2>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p><em>AIGC will soon surpass human sport coaches, and here&#x27;s why:</em></p>
<p><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Human trainers are unable to analyze large amounts of data as fast as AI would. Probably one of the main advantages of AI is high speed in processing and analyzing big volumes of complex data about the health status of athletes to make better decisions and improve the process of training.</p>
<p><strong>Availability.</strong> Unlike human trainers, who are restricted to their personal time and schedules, AIGCs don&#x27;t need breaks or days off. At any moment, whichever the time zone or other restrictions, they are available, providing necessary support or feedback continuously. AI trainers are always in touch to help.</p>
<p><strong>Subsequence.</strong> The human factor is reflected in the stability of the training process: human coaches may be in different moods, have biases, or other subjective factors. AI overcomes these shortcomings by offering a consistent coaching approach based on rigorous algorithms. This means that the quality of your training will always be consistent.</p>
<p><strong>Long-term tracking:</strong> AI has surpassed the capabilities of human coaches in tracking athlete performance over time. It still proves hard for a human even with the use of modern applications in data management. AI is constantly analyzing and adapting the training procedure with long-term data that shifts the athlete better toward his goals.</p>
<p><strong>Scalability</strong>. AI coaches can work with as many athletes at one time as an individual wishes, which is impossible for human coaches working one-on-one or with groups. That is why AI has become an indistinguishable tool in mass coaching.</p>
<p><strong>Flexibility</strong>. AI can make the training programs personalized to the needs of each athlete. The immediacy with which AI adapts in real time, based on the changing new data inputs, is second to none. AI by AI Program in a part of decentralized AI model training will continuously enhance AIGC’s into state-of-the-art, adaptive, and effective in any environment.</p>
<p><strong>Neutrality</strong>. AICGs have no personal biases and psychological factors that can influence human trainers&#x27; decisions. That is to say, there is an objective approach towards training: every athlete is treated on an equal footing, being effectively motivated to achieve whatever they aim to.</p>
<p><strong>Availability</strong>. AI sport coaching is usually more accessible and cheaper as compared to classes with human coaches. This offers a chance of professional coaching to more beginner athletes.</p>
<p><strong>Economic accessibility</strong>. That is an economical benefit for AI as well. For example, an hour&#x27;s training with a tennis coach costs on average US$100, while services of the AI coach are 100 times cheaper. A subscription for AI coaches in different sports will cost about $20 per month, which will allow everyone to develop healthy habits and achieve high results.</p>
<p>AIGC&#x27;s are always on duty. By implementing GAP (Grade Adjusted Pace) models and robust speech recognition, AIGC&#x27;s can create highly adaptive, personal training plans for non-pro athletes, keeping their unique goals, fitness levels, and progress in mind. It gives a more accurate reflection of an athlete&#x27;s efforts and guides their training effectively via gamified training blocks. AIGC&#x27;s are constantly learning from athletes using realistic NLP engine and by processing athlete&#x27;s health data coming from various sources such as Strava, Google Fit, Garmin Health, etc.</p>

<li><p>Sports-related CV models running on mobile devices, CDN Distributed, open source, decentralized. Applied technologies: modified NAS Yolo Pose. Now migrating to &quot;Sapiens&quot; ViT);</p>
</li>
<li><p>Vision Transformers (ViT) allow us to analyze users&#x27; movements during training with high accuracy and a speed of 60fps. ViT models work on the principle of transformers and are fully integrated into language models. They divide the image into small areas (patches) and process them using attention mechanisms. This makes it possible to more effectively recognize complex movements and postures of athletes;</p>
</li>
<li><p>ViT can more efficiently  process raw video on user devices than convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that are typically used in computer vision systems.</p>
</li>
<li><p>ViT can recognize complex sequences of athlete movements. This is especially useful for improving exercise technique in real time, offering users more accurate and personalized recommendations from an AI coach.</p>
</li>
<li><p>ViT can recognize the smallest details in images, allowing for better recognition of fine motor skills and recording deviations in exercise technique. For example, the slightest deviations in tennis or gymnastics can negatively affect the final results (in competitions).</p>
</li>
<li><p>ViT requires less resources for training and video processing (output). The video no longer needs to be uploaded to the server, and the entire process of interaction between the Athlete and the AI ​​occurs in real time. This way, our AI will be able to process videos directly on users&#x27; devices, reducing the wait time between completing exercises and receiving recommendations.</p>

        <span><strong>DAO functions in detail:</strong></span>
    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p><strong>Preparation steps</strong></p>
<p>Actiquest is establishing the Actiq DAO with the intention to operate and further develop an incentivisation platform powered by AI, owned by the public. The DAO and its services are destined to go live on the Internet Computer Protocol by using approved NNS SNS Containers and SNS subnet. Actiquest hereby requests approval by NNS for the creation and maintenance of this decentralized autonomous organization.</p>
<p><strong>Launching DAO</strong></p>
<p>The Actiquest team is going to submit an NNS Proposal for the launch of the Actiq DAO, mentioning the parameters of a &quot;decentralized sale&quot; and how tokens are initially distributed. Once this proposal is approved, the NNS will create a decentralized sale of the $ACTI Tokens, giving the control of the platform to the Token Holders and raising funds for its development and growth. The sale will be open to all except for citizens living in the restricted list of countries. The actual buying of tokens will be made through the NNS launchpad, where users will be able to deposit $ICP equivalent in value to the number of $ACTI tokens they want to purchase. At the close of the sale, all funds collected will be transferred into an account controlled by the new DAO.</p>
<p><strong>Control over the DAO</strong></p>
<p>After the sale, the DAO will own the Actiq platform with its treasury holding $ACTI and $ICP tokens. During decentralization, the power will transfer to SNS, which will also take control of the treasury and any further changes on the platform. No change can be promoted on the platform or even the access to the DAO funds before the proposal gets its approval. Anyone can make a proposal to the DAO, and it should subsequently be implemented, pending a vote by the $ACTI token holders.</p>
<p><strong>Further DAO Management</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Proposals are a way to state intent without necessarily having concrete practical outcomes associated with the acceptance of those proposals. They can be used to propose new features, determine priorities for the development team and much more.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Modernize canisters. The drive upgrade offering includes the drive ID and the WebAssembly Module - WASM. Once approved, SNS will update the code of the specified drive with the new WASM module that will enable enhancing the smart contracts of the application.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Configuration changes. Changes in ACTI SNS configuration are. A detailed description of the choices made for the initial setup is given here (TBA).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Token transfers: It is possible to propose that allows transferring tokens in or out of a DAO treasury. Treasury can store any token built into the IC ecosystem, including but not restricted to, $ICP, $ACTI etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Burning. Proposals for burning the $ACTI tokens may be submitted as a way of reducing the total supply-for example, a physical goods market where participants in the sports ecosystem can exchange their goods for $ACTI tokens, which shall be burnt upon every exchange.</p>

<p><strong>Roadmap</strong></p>
<p>At the same time, we develop the AI ​​and web3 infrastructure of our product. We moved from simple to complex-in June, we launched a Telegram mini-app to popularize our product and attracted 50K users. Due to Actiq Wallet, we will be able to afford the main product launch cost-effectively-with ACTICat Coach supporting a number of sports-and offer it to a paying audience of 100K users in Q1 of 2025. We are going to launch co-teaching this October for our sports models with the help of more than 1000 athletes who come from various sports and cooperation programs with sports coaches.</p>

Opposed to humanoid robots from _Will Smith starring Sci-Fi thriller ‚ÄúI Robot‚Äù_, cat-like AIGC character design could make the whole process of learning and training more fun-less intimidating. Optimus robots, Cybercab robo-taxis, and Robovan buses were completely inspired by this film, which means that the marketing of robotic innovations is surprisingly predictable.

Why a cat? Humanoid robots sometimes fall into an "uncanny valley" where they are almost human but with subtle differences that are disquieting. The virtual cat character avoids this problem in its entirety by taking on a very non-human form that is universally attractive and non-threatening. People have a natural affection for animals, cats especially. This helps, in some cases, to work out a sense of camaraderie and, therefore, motivation to make the workout experience more comfortable.

It is possible to attribute a personality to ACTIcat, adapting it to different age ranges, sports, and forms of training in such a way that the AI will adapt to different users' needs.

Thus, it might be that athletes get emotionally tied with the sweet and friendly AIGC; hence, commitment to the training program increases. Therefore, with this, it will keep them more motivated by sticking to your exercise schedule.

[[{"l":"Actiquest"},{"l":"Introduction","p":["Yet, at the dawn of the era of robots, on October 11, 2024, Tesla arranged an incredible presentation called \"We, Robot\" and presented robotaxis there, along with Optimus robots. When Tesla finished its presentation, a stream showed a number of people communicating with robots on tables and in the crowd. However, the robots greeted with their arms, poured drinks, and danced; that is why some guests felt like they were controlled by real people remotely.","Yet, not everybody can afford a $30,000+ robot. In most cases, a robot doesn't even need to have a physical body to be able to assist a person in his or her daily routine. It can live in your smartphone and a variety of AR wearable devices and bring no less benefits than Optimus.","In an era where the intersection of AI technologies, Web3 and sports opens up new horizons, Actiquest Lab created a revolutionary application that effectively digitizes sports coaching."]},{"l":"Actiq: training app for athletes powered by AI and web3 incentives","p":["Actiq is a state-of-the-art application for all sports fans, which opens completely new perspectives in mastering various types of sports-tennis, padel, cricket, baseball, etc. The application is powered by the latest developments in Artificial Intelligence Gamified Coach (AIGC) technology and enhanced with web3 based train2earn mechanics.","Actiq is able to see and hear the user in training. This means interactive communication with him and training on an individual basis. The app offers:","Actiq is your highway to the peaks of sports perfection with the support of artificial intelligence and technologies of a novel motivation system.","Actiq Wallet is a Telegram mini-app developed by Actiquest, and with this, the company wants to actively promote the coming product. Using it, one can gain $ACTI by accomplishing various social and sporting challenges. The intent is also to prepare them for the upcoming Actiq mobile app in 2025.","Analysis of technology and progress","Average state at 01/10/2024:","DAU 10K","Goal setting and tracking","Individual training plans","Link to Actiq Wallet.","MAU 30K","One of the distinctive features of Actiq is its reward system.

This is done by installing Strava, connecting wearable devices to it, and earning $ACTI through Strava task cards in Actiq Wallet. You can also download the mobile app and get a promotion code for free use of Actiq in the Actiq Wallet for the first 6 months."]},{"l":"Vision and Mission"},{"l":"Vision","p":["Power innovations that will improve the health and quality of life for billions of people around the globe using the latest AI. Ease human trainers' burden by making personalized AI sport coaches available 24/7, which will offer tailored training and in-game rewards. We want to democratize sport by making it accessible to all, regardless of their skill level."]},{"l":"Mission","p":["We are designing a new approach to training for all athletes by mixing gamification and the power of AI. Further, sport coaching will be revolutionized by AI Coaches combined with personalized omni-sport approach. We will develop an app through which you can make money with sports, integrating Social-Fi aspects that connect sport lovers via gamified workout and sports activities."]},{"l":"Problem Statement","p":["The demand for sports training is huge and keeps growing. Sports coaches are expensive (in the US, 1 hour of tennis classes may start from $100) and are also limited by their human nature, to train everyone. Coaches are constantly looking for new ways of monetizing their abilities: releasing video lessons and training athletes remotely.","Increasing demand for personalized training and workouts. The consumers want unique training programs tailored to different personality traits, goals, and lifestyles. Traditional fitness apps offer general program modes that cannot address the individual needs of all users.","Increased demand for home workouts and sports conducted remotely. Such a trend has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, when many people continue to choose to exercise at home or outdoors, avoiding crowded gyms.","Growing interest is taken in sports-derived VR and AR technologies. Immersive training and sports skills training open new opportunities, though high equipment costs and lack of quality content restrain their adoption.","Low motivation of athletes to master new sports. A person is capable of mastering several sports in order for his body to be physically harmonious. In the digital age, this means he has to download several applications, start synchronizing data, find time to study, and much, much more. But a modern multimodal AI agent will be able to methodologically and organizationally solve this problem completely and even motivate such useful interests using web3 rewards.","Web3 users are too poorly engaged in a healthy lifestyle due to excessive time spent on the computer/smartphone and engagement in play2earn casual games. At the moment, the lack of projects connected with sports and an active way of life in the Web3 industry plays a significant role here. The first representatives of these projects are STEPN and Agon, which connect the advantages of Web3 technologies with engagement in physical activities."]},{"l":"Possible solution","p":["Solution will combine cutting-edge AI technologies with Web3 tech stack to introduce the groundbreaking sports training platform."]},{"l":"Multimodal AI for Sports","p":["Integration of latest Vision Transformer (ViT) technology to analyze visual information about the athlete's workouts.","Optimizing ViT to spend fewer resources for training and processing video data (inference).","Using Actiq Sport Knowledge LLM to create personalized training programs and recommendations.","Implementing D.R.O.C methodology (Distilling and Retrieving Generalizable Knowledge via Language Corrections), which allows Actiq Sport Knowledge LLM to make real-time judgments on the quality of exercise performance and correct the athlete's technique. D.R.O.C instantly detects errors or incorrect movements and gives the user feedback, helping them improve their technique without the need for repeated workout reviews or consultations with a trainer. That will work like a special RAG over Llama and allows to continuously improve algorithms based on user data.","Regular updates to the knowledge base of AI coaches, taking into account the latest research in the field of sports science."]},{"l":"Tools for maximizing sport motivation, gamification of sports experience and Actiq web3 ecosystem growth","p":["Incentivization protocol based on $ACTI, a cross-chain cryptocurrency, specifically designed to reward sports achievements across mass adopted ecosystems like Solana, TON, BNB, SKALE, ICP chains.","DAO for managing and decision-making on development of incentivization protocol, $ACTI circulation across several blockchain ecosystems and storage/commercial use of pre-trained models both ViT and Sport Knowledge LLM as a public good owned by the DAO community.","Oracles to decentralize AI training data coming from centralized sources and secure AI model ownership by athletes.","Cross-Chain Bridges for free $ACTI circulation between crypto ecosystems, mentioned above.","Development of a system of levels, achievements and competitions between users.","Virtual challenges and tournaments to increase engagement.","Providing 24/7 access to personalized training.","The ability to train anywhere, anytime, using only your smartphone and wearable peripherals (sensors, watches etc.).","The given solution will revolutionize the concept of sports training and make quality training accessible to all. A blend of AI technologies with the engines of Web3 democratizes access not only to professional training but also creates a new paradigm in the sports industry, where technology becomes one of the key factors for achieving physical excellence and a healthy lifestyle."]},{"l":"The technologies behind Actiquest","p":["Our team has been developing in the field of computer vision for more than 7 years. Early next year, we are launching the release of Actiq, a sports super-app with multimodal AI under the hood. You can train in several sports disciplines using just one app for all sports: tennis, paddle, baseball, golf, track your games, compete, lead an active lifestyle, and even earn money in the application. Beginners who aren't sure what they want and what sports they like will find it helpful. We develop special AI technology for sports, combining GenAI with advanced Vision Transformers, machine learning that processes fitness data from various sources, recognizes health problems, and correctly assesses your capabilities, with generative AI reasoning to implement the emotional and motivational component, and to make sure the communication with you is in your native language.","By investigating limitations of the Video LLM approach of recognizing frames of a scene and reasoning over what happened next, we are in a position to combine real-time multi-threaded vision transformers with our custom distillation and online correction (D.R.O.C) tools in the most effective way to respond to corrections. This is generally a very good process for undergoing athletic training.","D.R.O.C stands for Distilling and Retrieving Generalizable Knowledge via Online Corrections, which essentially enables AI to make real-time decisions regarding the quality of exercise performance and allows adjustments in technique to be made by the athlete. The D.R.O.C. technology instantly recognizes mistakes or wrong movements and gives users feedback that helps them enhance their technique without the need to review workouts or consult with a coach. As such, this not only makes training more efficient but also safer, reducing the chances of injury while accelerating results.","High-accuracy Vision Transformers operating at 60 frames per second enable the analysis of user movements during training. The principle of operation of transformer models called ViT is fully integrated with language models. They divide an image into small areas and process them by attention mechanisms. That allows for the recognition of more complex movements and postures of athletes more effectively.","Among computer vision systems, the ViT technologies are even more resource-efficient than convolutional neural networks:","This is beneficial for ViT since it can detect complex sequences of athlete movements; hence, it is helpful in real-time exercise technique improvements, enabling users to provide more correct feedback from an AI coach. With ViT, we will be able to recognize even the tiniest details of images for better acknowledgment of fine motor skills and recording deviations from exercise technique. For instance, the slightest deviations in tennis or gymnastics have a negative effect on final results when it comes to competition.","ViT requires less resource consumption both for training and video processing at the inferencing stage. It would also no longer be necessary to upload a video to the server, and the entire process of interaction between the Athlete and the AI ​​happens in real time. Our AI, in turn, in such a way, can process videos directly on users' devices and provide a reduction in wait time after the completion of exercises before receiving recommendations.","Also, the user need not worry about sensitive personal data since the video stream is not being transmitted to anywhere; only the anonymized metadata will be transmitted to the Sport Knowledge LLM."]},{"l":"Competitors","p":["One Page Study of Actiquest competitors.Competitors include Web2 tracking apps without AI and rewards tools (Strava) or apps like StepN, which have a lower impact on sports and wellness.","Examples: Stepn ( https://Stepn.com- now Stepn is a division of the Adidas loyalty program), Agon https://apps.apple.com/us/app/agon-fitness-rewards/id1574023421, Athletica ( https://athletica.ai/), Fitbod ( https://fitbod.me/), Zing ( https://www.zing.coach/), Evolve ( https://www.evolveai.app/), Enduco ( https://enduco.app/)","The B2B2C sports innovation market is estimated to reach $200B by 2026. We believe that our product integrating AI and web3 will quickly occupy its niche in the Sport-Tech market. Our technologies will be integrated into Meta AR/VR entertainment infrastructure in the near future."]},{"l":"Social effect","p":["Actiq is a project related to sports and health, based on the latest developments in the field of artificial intelligence and implemented on web3. We work with the biggest thought leaders in sports, crypto and artificial intelligence to deliver our ideas around the world.

Introduction"},{"l":"2.1 Background","p":["The rapid ascent of artificial intelligence(AI) in domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, and personalized recommendations has often hinged on centralized data pipelines. Traditional AI workflows store large volumes of data in monolithic data centers, train models on powerful, centralized compute clusters, and then deliver these models to end users—often via cloud APIs. However, this model presents several shortcomings:","Privacy Concerns: Centralized datasets can be vulnerable to leaks or unauthorized usage.","Single Points of Failure: A single entity controlling data and model access can impose censorship, raise fees, or unilaterally change usage terms.","Limited Community Involvement: Contributors (e.g., data owners, labelers, or subject-matter experts) typically have little direct input into model curation or governance.","Scalability & Latency: Constantly streaming data to and from the cloud can be costly and introduce performance bottlenecks, especially for real-time or sensor-based applications."]},{"l":"2.2.

A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) or Service Nervous System (SNS) on ICP oversees dataset curation, usage terms, and revenue distributions—enabling transparent decision-making.","Compute-to-Data.

A groundbreaking approach, local request processing, is emerging as a critical strategy, promising to locally handle up to 80% of user queries. This paradigm shift can significantly reduce the burden on centralized servers, minimize communication latency, and dramatically improve response times, leading to a superior user experience.","The feasibility of achieving this 80% efficiency hinges on recognizing and leveraging the inherent repetitiveness in user requests. Studies across various domains consistently show high rates of recurring queries:","Data Warehouses: In 50% of Amazon Redshift database clusters, a striking 80% of queries are exact repetitions of previous ones.","Customer Support: A high \"First Contact Resolution\" rate (80-90%) in customer service indicates that a large volume of common issues are successfully resolved, suggesting a high degree of repeatable inquiries.","Search Engines: Analysis of web and corporate search logs reveals significant query reuse, with some data showing 33% of web searches are identical repetitions by the same user.","To harness this repetition, three cutting-edge technologies are pivotal:","Cache-Augmented Generation (CAG): This technique supercharges AI response generation by pre-loading relevant information directly into the Large Language Model's (LLM) context. By pre-computing key-value caches, CAG eliminates the need for real-time information retrieval, resulting in up to 40% faster responses than traditional methods and dramatically cutting down generation times for stable knowledge bases.","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): RAG dynamically pulls relevant data from external knowledge bases to enrich user queries before an LLM generates a response. Local implementations of RAG offer unparalleled privacy, cost-effectiveness, and ensure access to the most current information, making them ideal for sensitive or frequently updated private data repositories.","Semantic Cache and Retrieval (SCR): Operating at the gateway level, SCR intelligently caches responses based on the semantic meaning, rather than just exact text matches, of queries. Utilizing vector databases, SCR can identify and serve semantically similar requests, significantly reducing computational load on LLMs. This leads to substantial cost savings—for instance, a common greeting query with 100% cache hits could save $90,000 annually—and delivers sub-millisecond response times.","Achieving the ambitious 80% local processing goal is not automatic but requires strategic infrastructure development:","Maturity of Knowledge-Centric Gateways (KCG) and Knowledge Graphs (KG): A robust, well-structured, and regularly updated knowledge graph is the bedrock for effective semantic processing. It provides the essential context and relationships for accurate retrieval and caching by RAG and SCR systems.","Optimized Local Caching Systems: Effective caching demands sophisticated architectural design, including distributed caching for scalability, stringent mechanisms to maintain cache coherence, and adaptive, context-aware policies. These policies adjust based on user behavior, data characteristics (stability, volume, and update frequency), and network conditions, maximizing the efficiency of cache hits.","In essence, while the 80% local processing rate is an ambitious target, it is highly attainable for systems that are meticulously designed to exploit recurring query patterns. A comprehensive strategy that includes thorough analysis of existing query patterns, strategic investment in high-quality knowledge management infrastructure, and the intelligent integration of CAG, RAG, and SCR technologies will be key.

For instance, an age field must be a number.","Range and Value Constraints: Ensuring data falls within permissible ranges (e.g., age between 0 and 120) or matches a predefined set of allowed values (e.g., country code from an approved list).","Uniqueness Checks: Verifying that a field or combination of fields is unique where required (e.g., user ID, order number).","Completeness Checks (Mandatory Fields): Ensuring all required fields are present in the data payload.","Referential Integrity: In systems where data elements reference others (e.g., a customer ID in an order), gateways might validate the format or existence (if feasible through a lookup service) of such identifiers (IDs).","Checksums and Hashes: Verifying data has not been altered during transmission by comparing calculated checksums or cryptographic hashes (e.g., MD5, SHA-256) against provided ones.","Length Constraints: Ensuring string lengths or array sizes are within defined minimum and maximum limits."]},{"l":"3.2. Data Formatting Checks","p":["Data formatting checks ensure that data adheres to the expected structural and syntactic rules:","Syntax Validation:","JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) Validation: Ensuring JSON data is well-formed (correct syntax, matching braces, commas, etc.).","XML (Extensible Markup Language) Validation: Ensuring XML data is well-formed (correct tags, nesting, attributes).","Schema Compliance: This is a critical check where data is validated against a predefined schema that describes its structure, data types, required fields, and constraints.","JSON Schema: For JSON payloads, gateways use JSON Schema definitions to validate the structure and content.","XML Schema (XSD): For XML payloads, gateways use XSDs to ensure compliance.","OpenAPI Specification (OAS): API Gateways heavily rely on OAS (formerly Swagger) documents, which embed JSON Schema for defining and validating request/response parameters, headers, and bodies.","Encoding Validation: Verifying correct character encoding (e.g., UTF-8).","Specific Format Patterns: Using regular expressions (regex) to validate formats like email addresses, phone numbers, dates (e.g., ISO 8601), Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), etc."]},{"l":"3.3. Specifics: JSON-LD Validation","p":["JSON for Linking Data (JSON-LD) is a W3C standard for encoding linked data using JSON. Validating JSON-LD involves several aspects:","Basic JSON Syntax: It must be valid JSON.","JSON-LD Syntax and Structure: Adherence to JSON-LD keywords (e.g., @context, @id, @type, @graph) and structural rules defined in the JSON-LD 1.1 specification. JSON-LD processors check for errors like invalid @context definitions or improper use of keywords.","Context Validation: The @context is crucial. It can be an inline object or a link (URL) to an external context document. Validation involves:","Ensuring the context itself is valid JSON.","Resolving any referenced external contexts (with considerations for caching and security).","Checking for correct term definitions, type coercions, and IRI mappings within the context.","Schema/Shape Validation: While JSON-LD itself ensures structural integrity based on its processing rules (e.g., expanding, compacting, framing), validating the actual meaning and expected structure of the data often requires an additional schema layer:","JSON Schema: After potentially \"framing\" the JSON-LD document into a specific tree structure desired by an application, that framed JSON can be validated against a standard JSON Schema. Tools and libraries may adopt this \"frame-then-validate\" pattern.","SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language): For validating the underlying RDF graph represented by JSON-LD, SHACL can be used. SHACL defines \"shapes\" that data graphs must conform to.","Gateway validation of JSON-LD would typically involve ensuring it's syntactically correct JSON-LD and then, if a schema is defined (e.g., via JSON Schema for a framed representation), validating against that."]},{"l":"3.4. Specifics: Metadata Format Validation","p":["Gateways may also validate specific metadata formats attached to data or used in requests. Common examples include:","Dublin Core™ (DC): A widely used metadata schema providing a set of 15 core elements (e.g., Title, Creator, Date, Subject). Validation can involve:","Checking for the presence of mandatory DC elements as per an application profile.","Validating the format of element values (e.g., ISO 8601 for dates).","Using tools like ShEx or SHACL if the DC metadata is represented in RDF (e.g., RDFa, JSON-LD).","XSLT-based validators have also been common for XML-encoded DC.","Schema.org: A collaborative, community activity with a mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond.

The Gateway Validation Process","p":["The process of data validation within a gateway typically follows these automated steps upon receiving a request (and similarly, before sending a response if applicable):","Initial Connection & Parsing: The gateway receives the request, parses basic protocol information (e.g., HTTP headers).","Security Checks: Authentication (e.g., API keys, OAuth tokens) and authorization (access rights) are verified first.","Parameter Validation: Path parameters, query parameters, and headers are validated against definitions (e.g., from an OpenAPI spec for an API gateway). This includes type, format, and presence checks.","Content-Type Validation: The gateway checks if the Content-Type header (e.g., application/json, application/xml) is supported and matches the actual payload format.","Message Size Validation: The size of the request/response body is checked against configured limits to prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks or resource exhaustion.","Syntactic Validation: The payload is checked for well-formedness (e.g., valid JSON or XML structure).","Schema Compliance Validation: The payload is validated against its defined schema (e.g., JSON Schema, XSD). This is often the most intensive data validation step, checking structure, data types, required fields, and constraints.","Specific Integrity & Custom Logic Checks: Additional data integrity checks (e.g., checksums if provided) or custom business rule validations (if configured at the gateway level) are performed.","Logging: The outcome of validation (success or failure, with error details if any) is logged.","Action:","If Valid: The request is forwarded to the appropriate backend service (or the response is sent to the client).","If Invalid: The gateway rejects the request with an appropriate error code (e.g., HTTP 400 Bad Request) and a descriptive error message. It does not forward the invalid data."]},{"l":"5. Relationship between Gateway Validation and Consensus Mechanisms","p":["The relationship between gateway validation and consensus mechanisms depends on the system architecture:","Centralized/Traditional Systems: In systems without distributed consensus for data writes (e.g., a typical microservice architecture behind an API gateway), the gateway is a primary validator. There isn't a \"consensus\" step for the validation itself among multiple gateways in the same way as a blockchain. However, consistency is crucial:","Consistent Policy Enforcement: If multiple gateway instances exist (e.g., for load balancing or high availability), they must all apply the same validation rules. This is typically achieved through centralized configuration management and deployment.","Consistent Logging: Validation results from all instances should be logged to a central system for coherent monitoring and auditing.","No Data Consensus at Gateway Level: Gateways validate independently. If data passes validation at one gateway and is written to a backend system, that backend system (e.g., a database (DB)) handles its own data consistency, possibly using its own consensus or replication mechanisms if it's a distributed DB.","Distributed Ledger/Blockchain Systems: Here, validation and consensus are tightly coupled.","Nodes in the network (which might include specialized gateway nodes) validate incoming transactions or data submissions against the ledger's rules (format, signatures, business logic).","A consensus mechanism (e.g., PoW, PoS) is then used by the network to agree on the order and validity of a batch of these validated transactions before they are immutably recorded on the ledger.","In this scenario, gateway validation is an initial step, and the consensus mechanism provides the final, distributed agreement on what validated data becomes part of the shared truth.","In essence, gateways always perform validation. How this validation relates to broader consensus depends on whether the underlying system architecture relies on a formal consensus protocol for data agreement and state changes. For most non-blockchain systems, gateway validation is a critical data quality and security measure, with \"consistency\" across multiple gateways being an operational goal rather than a protocol-driven consensus outcome for each data packet."]},{"l":"Knowledge Cache Graph (KCG) Data Model & Indexing","p":["The Knowledge Cache Graph (KCG) serves as the immutable, decentralized knowledge memory layer for the ecosystem.

This new entry undergoes validation by Gateways and Validators.","Updating Indexing Layers: While the KCG data itself is immutable, the indexing layers managed by Gateways (e.g., Gateway KV-cache, off-chain semantic indexes) are mutable. These layers are updated to point to the latest and most relevant versions of knowledge in the KCG. The \"Workflow Overview\" states that after validation, the Gateway records the entry into the KCG, and a \"corresponding KV entry is updated in the public KCG KV-layer for efficient future retrieval\". This \"update\" likely refers to adding new pointers or updating metadata associated with pointers to immutable KCG data to ensure access to the current version.","Marking and Deprioritization: Outdated entries can be marked as such or deprioritized in the mutable Gateway indexes. This ensures that when a query is made, the Selective Contextual Reasoning (SCR) system retrieves the current information.","Semantic Overlap: Newer, more complete, or more accurate knowledge entries may semantically overlap with older ones. The older entry remains on Arweave, but the system prioritizes the newer one.","Although the document does not explicitly mention protocols like ArFS (Arweave File System) or ArNS (Arweave Name System), the described architecture is compatible with using such systems for version management (e.g., where a name points to the TXID of the current knowledge version).

For deployment (inference), you have options:","Deploy the original base model (e.g., in FP16) along with the new LoRA adapters (also typically FP16). In this case, the total size on the device increases slightly due to the adapters.","Deploy a quantized version of the base model (e.g., INT4 or INT8) alongside the LoRA adapters (FP16).

However, this increase is far less than if a much larger, fully fine-tuned model were used.","Conclusion for the Use Case: Periodic QLoRA fine-tuning of an SLM using daily knowledge accumulated in Membria's KCG (e.g., 50,000 tokens) offers an effective strategy for continuous improvement. This process, likely automated and run offline over several hours, can significantly enhance the model's accuracy and relevance concerning new information. It achieves this while maintaining a minimal, or even reduced, model size on end-user devices (when leveraging base model quantization for inference) and can potentially improve inference speed.

There isn't a \"consensus\" step for the validation itself among multiple gateways in the same way as a blockchain. However, consistency is crucial:","Consistent Policy Enforcement: If multiple gateway instances exist (e.g., for load balancing or high availability), they must all apply the same validation rules. This is typically achieved through centralized configuration management and deployment.","Consistent Logging: Validation results from all instances should be logged to a central system for coherent monitoring and auditing.","No Data Consensus at Gateway Level: Gateways validate independently. If data passes validation at one gateway and is written to a backend system, that backend system (e.g., a database (DB)) handles its own data consistency, possibly using its own consensus or replication mechanisms if it's a distributed DB.","Distributed Ledger/Blockchain Systems: Here, validation and consensus are tightly coupled.","Nodes in the network (which might include specialized gateway nodes) validate incoming transactions or data submissions against the ledger's rules (format, signatures, business logic).","A consensus mechanism (e.g., PoW, PoS) is then used by the network to agree on the order and validity of a batch of these validated transactions before they are immutably recorded on the ledger.","In this scenario, gateway validation is an initial step, and the consensus mechanism provides the final, distributed agreement on what validated data becomes part of the shared truth.","In essence, gateways always perform validation. How this validation relates to broader consensus depends on whether the underlying system architecture relies on a formal consensus protocol for data agreement and state changes.

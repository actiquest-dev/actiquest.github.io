When Tesla finished its presentation, a stream showed a number of people communicating with robots on tables and in the crowd. However, the robots greeted with their arms, poured drinks, and danced; that is why some guests felt like they were controlled by real people remotely.","Yet, not everybody can afford a $30,000+ robot. In most cases, a robot doesn't even need to have a physical body to be able to assist a person in his or her daily routine. It can live in your smartphone and a variety of AR wearable devices and bring no less benefits than Optimus.","In an era where the intersection of AI technologies, Web3 and sports opens up new horizons, Actiquest Lab created a revolutionary application that effectively digitizes sports coaching."]},{"i":"actiq-training-app-for-athletes-powered-by-ai-and-web3-incentives","l":"Actiq: training app for athletes powered by AI and web3 incentives","p":["Actiq is a state-of-the-art application for all sports fans, which opens completely new perspectives in mastering various types of sports-tennis, padel, cricket, baseball, etc. The application is powered by the latest developments in Artificial Intelligence Gamified Coach (AIGC) technology and enhanced with web3 based train2earn mechanics.","Actiq is able to see and hear the user in training. This means interactive communication with him and training on an individual basis. The app offers:","Actiq is your highway to the peaks of sports perfection with the support of artificial intelligence and technologies of a novel motivation system.","Actiq Wallet is a Telegram mini-app developed by Actiquest, and with this, the company wants to actively promote the coming product. Using it, one can gain $ACTI by accomplishing various social and sporting challenges.

Ease human trainers' burden by making personalized AI sport coaches available 24/7, which will offer tailored training and in-game rewards. We want to democratize sport by making it accessible to all, regardless of their skill level."]},{"l":"Mission","p":["We are designing a new approach to training for all athletes by mixing gamification and the power of AI. Further, sport coaching will be revolutionized by AI Coaches combined with personalized omni-sport approach. We will develop an app through which you can make money with sports, integrating Social-Fi aspects that connect sport lovers via gamified workout and sports activities."]},{"l":"Problem Statement","p":["The demand for sports training is huge and keeps growing. Sports coaches are expensive (in the US, 1 hour of tennis classes may start from $100) and are also limited by their human nature, to train everyone. Coaches are constantly looking for new ways of monetizing their abilities: releasing video lessons and training athletes remotely.","Increasing demand for personalized training and workouts. The consumers want unique training programs tailored to different personality traits, goals, and lifestyles. Traditional fitness apps offer general program modes that cannot address the individual needs of all users.","Increased demand for home workouts and sports conducted remotely. Such a trend has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, when many people continue to choose to exercise at home or outdoors, avoiding crowded gyms.","Growing interest is taken in sports-derived VR and AR technologies. Immersive training and sports skills training open new opportunities, though high equipment costs and lack of quality content restrain their adoption.","Low motivation of athletes to master new sports. A person is capable of mastering several sports in order for his body to be physically harmonious. In the digital age, this means he has to download several applications, start synchronizing data, find time to study, and much, much more. But a modern multimodal AI agent will be able to methodologically and organizationally solve this problem completely and even motivate such useful interests using web3 rewards.","Web3 users are too poorly engaged in a healthy lifestyle due to excessive time spent on the computer/smartphone and engagement in play2earn casual games. At the moment, the lack of projects connected with sports and an active way of life in the Web3 industry plays a significant role here. The first representatives of these projects are STEPN and Agon, which connect the advantages of Web3 technologies with engagement in physical activities."]},{"l":"Possible solution","p":["Solution will combine cutting-edge AI technologies with Web3 tech stack to introduce the groundbreaking sports training platform."]},{"l":"Multimodal AI for Sports","p":["Integration of latest Vision Transformer (ViT) technology to analyze visual information about the athlete's workouts.","Optimizing ViT to spend fewer resources for training and processing video data (inference).","Using Actiq Sport Knowledge LLM to create personalized training programs and recommendations.","Implementing D.R.O.C methodology (Distilling and Retrieving Generalizable Knowledge via Language Corrections), which allows Actiq Sport Knowledge LLM to make real-time judgments on the quality of exercise performance and correct the athlete's technique. D.R.O.C instantly detects errors or incorrect movements and gives the user feedback, helping them improve their technique without the need for repeated workout reviews or consultations with a trainer. That will work like a special RAG over Llama and allows to continuously improve algorithms based on user data.","Regular updates to the knowledge base of AI coaches, taking into account the latest research in the field of sports science."]},{"i":"tools-for-maximizing-sport-motivation-gamification-of-sports-experience-and-actiq-web3-ecosystem-growth","l":"Tools for maximizing sport motivation, gamification of sports experience and Actiq web3 ecosystem growth","p":["Incentivization protocol based on $ACTI, a cross-chain cryptocurrency, specifically designed to reward sports achievements across mass adopted ecosystems like Solana, TON, BNB, SKALE, ICP chains.","DAO for managing and decision-making on development of incentivization protocol, $ACTI circulation across several blockchain ecosystems and storage/commercial use of pre-trained models both ViT and Sport Knowledge LLM as a public good owned by the DAO community.","Oracles to decentralize AI training data coming from centralized sources and secure AI model ownership by athletes.","Cross-Chain Bridges for free $ACTI circulation between crypto ecosystems, mentioned above.","Development of a system of levels, achievements and competitions between users.","Virtual challenges and tournaments to increase engagement.","Providing 24/7 access to personalized training.","The ability to train anywhere, anytime, using only your smartphone and wearable peripherals (sensors, watches etc.).","The given solution will revolutionize the concept of sports training and make quality training accessible to all. A blend of AI technologies with the engines of Web3 democratizes access not only to professional training but also creates a new paradigm in the sports industry, where technology becomes one of the key factors for achieving physical excellence and a healthy lifestyle."]},{"l":"The technologies behind Actiquest","p":["Our team has been developing in the field of computer vision for more than 7 years. Early next year, we are launching the release of Actiq, a sports super-app with multimodal AI under the hood. You can train in several sports disciplines using just one app for all sports: tennis, paddle, baseball, golf, track your games, compete, lead an active lifestyle, and even earn money in the application. Beginners who aren't sure what they want and what sports they like will find it helpful. We develop special AI technology for sports, combining GenAI with advanced Vision Transformers, machine learning that processes fitness data from various sources, recognizes health problems, and correctly assesses your capabilities, with generative AI reasoning to implement the emotional and motivational component, and to make sure the communication with you is in your native language.","By investigating limitations of the Video LLM approach of recognizing frames of a scene and reasoning over what happened next, we are in a position to combine real-time multi-threaded vision transformers with our custom distillation and online correction (D.R.O.C) tools in the most effective way to respond to corrections. This is generally a very good process for undergoing athletic training.","D.R.O.C stands for Distilling and Retrieving Generalizable Knowledge via Online Corrections, which essentially enables AI to make real-time decisions regarding the quality of exercise performance and allows adjustments in technique to be made by the athlete. The D.R.O.C. technology instantly recognizes mistakes or wrong movements and gives users feedback that helps them enhance their technique without the need to review workouts or consult with a coach. As such, this not only makes training more efficient but also safer, reducing the chances of injury while accelerating results.","High-accuracy Vision Transformers operating at 60 frames per second enable the analysis of user movements during training. The principle of operation of transformer models called ViT is fully integrated with language models. They divide an image into small areas and process them by attention mechanisms. That allows for the recognition of more complex movements and postures of athletes more effectively.","Among computer vision systems, the ViT technologies are even more resource-efficient than convolutional neural networks:","This is beneficial for ViT since it can detect complex sequences of athlete movements; hence, it is helpful in real-time exercise technique improvements, enabling users to provide more correct feedback from an AI coach. With ViT, we will be able to recognize even the tiniest details of images for better acknowledgment of fine motor skills and recording deviations from exercise technique. For instance, the slightest deviations in tennis or gymnastics have a negative effect on final results when it comes to competition.","ViT requires less resource consumption both for training and video processing at the inferencing stage. It would also no longer be necessary to upload a video to the server, and the entire process of interaction between the Athlete and the AI ​​happens in real time. Our AI, in turn, in such a way, can process videos directly on users' devices and provide a reduction in wait time after the completion of exercises before receiving recommendations.","Also, the user need not worry about sensitive personal data since the video stream is not being transmitted to anywhere; only the anonymized metadata will be transmitted to the Sport Knowledge LLM."]},{"l":"Competitors","p":["One Page Study of Actiquest competitors.Competitors include Web2 tracking apps without AI and rewards tools (Strava) or apps like StepN, which have a lower impact on sports and wellness.","Examples: Stepn ( https://Stepn.com- now Stepn is a division of the Adidas loyalty program), Agon https://apps.apple.com/us/app/agon-fitness-rewards/id1574023421, Athletica ( https://athletica.ai/), Fitbod ( https://fitbod.me/), Zing ( https://www.zing.coach/), Evolve ( https://www.evolveai.app/), Enduco ( https://enduco.app/)","The B2B2C sports innovation market is estimated to reach $200B by 2026.

However, this model presents several shortcomings:","Privacy Concerns: Centralized datasets can be vulnerable to leaks or unauthorized usage.","Single Points of Failure: A single entity controlling data and model access can impose censorship, raise fees, or unilaterally change usage terms.","Limited Community Involvement: Contributors (e.g., data owners, labelers, or subject-matter experts) typically have little direct input into model curation or governance.","Scalability & Latency: Constantly streaming data to and from the cloud can be costly and introduce performance bottlenecks, especially for real-time or sensor-based applications."]},{"i":"22-vision-for-a-decentralized-on-device-ai-ecosystem","l":"2.2.

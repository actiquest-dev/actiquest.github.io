We're a platform that provides users with rewards for keeping fit, unlocking an additional income stream for participating in their usual exercise activities, or taking part in specific fitness-related challenges. It builds on the trend and success of play-to-earn, where users are rewarded, in cryptocurrency, for playing games.","Actiquest generally aims to incentivize fitness and sport, helping to reduce obesity and sedentariness, and giving users an opportunity to earn an income for improving their health. Indeed, researchers recently found that improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness lead to a significant reduction in all-cause and disease-specific mortality, with an individual’s maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) being strongly correlated with their life expectancy.","The term move-to-earn refers to the possibility of earning valuable rewards while doing activities like moving about, similar to P2E (play-to-earn), which has since been adopted by a variety of other apps that reward users for their activity.","Actiquest generates rewards in the form of blockchain-based digital tokens. Users are rewarded in native utility tokens for completing fitness-related tasks — such as walking, running, or swimming.","Actiquest tracks activity and completion of tasks using the data from a cell phone or fitness tracker. This is assessed to see if it qualifies for rewards. Earned tokens can then either be directly traded for goods and services within the application or sold/traded on an internal marketplace or external exchange for other cryptocurrencies.","AI powered anti-cheat technology will be employed to ensure that only genuine fitness data is taken into account in the reward calculation process."]},{"i":"vision--mission","l":"Vision & Mission"},{"l":"Vision","p":["Innovate better health & lifestyle technology for billions of people by acquiring non-crypto users to the crypto metaverse, where people can connect through fitness and sport activities."]},{"l":"Mission","p":["We will build up an activity-to-earn platform which could be extended with Social-Fi functions, which supports the connection between users and community through exercises such as Cycle, Run, Walk, Workout, Swim, Dance and more to come.

Each type of activity uses a specific activity-to-earn algorithm to mint $ACTI based on a combination of heart rate, track length, steps and speed data. All users' activities are monitored by in-app AI to avoid cheats and fraud. To start your Move to Earn, and mint $ACTI you must purchase any NFT Specialty in mode shops and if you want to get a $QUEST, you’ll need endurance (END). Otherwise you should mint $ACTI more slowly using your sport exercises only. Every 1 END is equivalent to 5 minutes of your moving, and only once you have done your NFT specialty purchasing."]},{"i":"nft-specialty-samples","l":"NFT specialty samples:","p":["Cycle marketplace: bikes, handlebars, frames, seats, helmets, forks, upgrades etc. Run marketplace: sneakers, socks, gloves, apparel, accessories, bags and more.","NFT chests:(geoquest achievements) on track. Users can collect special NFT Items while completing performance tasks on the track. This allows them to increase END value and generate more $ACTI lifetime.","NFT chest specialty items: drinks, energy boosters, collectibles etc. To collect chest items, users should perform a simple task: while located in the geofencing position where the chest exists, take a selfie and make a special pose which can be recognized by in-app AI.","Floating: Due to the loss/ weakness of your GPS/ Internet connection or the user is not moving properly, this will be shown which leads to the END losing (depends on the cases) and no QUEST earnings.","GPS Signal: no GPS with White, Poor GPS with red and green illustrates a capable GPS Signal.","NFT breeding: If a user is active in multi modes, for example: cycling + running in the same time period (day) it allows to breed all collected NFTs and collect more $ACTI/QUEST tokens.","ACTI minting algorithm. Each game mode is quite specific to mint $ACTI and depends on a combination of heart rate, track length, steps and speed data managed by AI. Every new level you train with Actiquest you should show better results to get more $ACTI. Your profit will drop by up to 90% if you slip outside of range (this also depends on the difference in speed with range) f.e. your bike speed will be over 30 kmph on the highland/rugged track.","NFT sport specialty item. Each item will help you obtain a different amount of $ACTI/QUEST. You can read more about the individual breakdown of each item in the NFT Properties Section. More items - more $ACTI/QUEST, but remember that END (endurance) required to be restored. END will be generated at a rate of 25% every 6 hours after NFT purchasing. (Fixed at UTC Time 00:00, 06:00, 12:00, 18:00) After the first 25% END restore the new QUEST tokens start to generate.","Attributes of NFT Performance. The higher the performance, the more QUEST per min you can obtain. From level 0-29, users can only achieve QUEST, but at level 30 and above, users can choose either $ACTI or $QUEST. Users are free to control the transition between these two monetization modes."]}]]

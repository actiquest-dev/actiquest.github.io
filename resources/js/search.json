When Tesla finished its presentation, a stream showed a number of people communicating with robots on tables and in the crowd. However, the robots greeted with their arms, poured drinks, and danced; that is why some guests felt like they were controlled by real people remotely.","Yet, not everybody can afford a $30,000+ robot. In most cases, a robot doesn't even need to have a physical body to be able to assist a person in his or her daily routine. It can live in your smartphone and a variety of AR wearable devices and bring no less benefits than Optimus.","In an era where the intersection of AI technologies, Web3 and sports opens up new horizons, Actiquest Lab created a revolutionary application that effectively digitizes sports coaching."]},{"l":"Problem Statement","p":["The demand for sports training is huge and keeps growing. Sports coaches are expensive (in the US, 1 hour of tennis classes may start from $100) and are also limited by their human nature, to train everyone. Coaches are constantly looking for new ways of monetizing their abilities: releasing video lessons and training athletes remotely.","Increasing demand for personalized training and workouts. The consumers want unique training programs tailored to different personality traits, goals, and lifestyles. Traditional fitness apps offer general program modes that cannot address the individual needs of all users.","Increased demand for home workouts and sports conducted remotely. Such a trend has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, when many people continue to choose to exercise at home or outdoors, avoiding crowded gyms.","Growing interest is taken in sports-derived VR and AR technologies. Immersive training and sports skills training open new opportunities, though high equipment costs and lack of quality content restrain their adoption.","Low motivation of athletes to master new sports. A person is capable of mastering several sports in order for his body to be physically harmonious. In the digital age, this means he has to download several applications, start synchronizing data, find time to study, and much, much more. But a modern multimodal AI agent will be able to methodologically and organizationally solve this problem completely and even motivate such useful interests using web3 rewards.","Web3 users are too poorly engaged in a healthy lifestyle due to excessive time spent on the computer/smartphone and engagement in play2earn casual games. At the moment, the lack of projects connected with sports and an active way of life in the Web3 industry plays a significant role here. The first representatives of these projects are STEPN and Agon, which connect the advantages of Web3 technologies with engagement in physical activities."]},{"l":"Problems are solving","p":["Demand in sports is significantly growing.

Probably one of the main advantages of AI is high speed in processing and analyzing big volumes of complex data about the health status of athletes to make better decisions and improve the process of training.","Availability. Unlike human trainers, who are restricted to their personal time and schedules, AIGCs don't need breaks or days off. At any moment, whichever the time zone or other restrictions, they are available, providing necessary support or feedback continuously. AI trainers are always in touch to help.","Subsequence. The human factor is reflected in the stability of the training process: human coaches may be in different moods, have biases, or other subjective factors. AI overcomes these shortcomings by offering a consistent coaching approach based on rigorous algorithms. This means that the quality of your training will always be consistent.","Long-term tracking: AI has surpassed the capabilities of human coaches in tracking athlete performance over time. It still proves hard for a human even with the use of modern applications in data management. AI is constantly analyzing and adapting the training procedure with long-term data that shifts the athlete better toward his goals.","Scalability. AI coaches can work with as many athletes at one time as an individual wishes, which is impossible for human coaches working one-on-one or with groups. That is why AI has become an indistinguishable tool in mass coaching.","Flexibility. AI can make the training programs personalized to the needs of each athlete. The immediacy with which AI adapts in real time, based on the changing new data inputs, is second to none. AI by AI Program in a part of decentralized AI model training will continuously enhance AIGC’s into state-of-the-art, adaptive, and effective in any environment.","Neutrality. AICGs have no personal biases and psychological factors that can influence human trainers' decisions. That is to say, there is an objective approach towards training: every athlete is treated on an equal footing, being effectively motivated to achieve whatever they aim to.","Availability. AI sport coaching is usually more accessible and cheaper as compared to classes with human coaches. This offers a chance of professional coaching to more beginner athletes.","Economic accessibility. That is an economical benefit for AI as well. For example, an hour's training with a tennis coach costs on average US$100, while services of the AI coach are 100 times cheaper. A subscription for AI coaches in different sports will cost about $20 per month, which will allow everyone to develop healthy habits and achieve high results.","AIGC's are always on duty. By implementing GAP (Grade Adjusted Pace) models and robust speech recognition, AIGC's can create highly adaptive, personal training plans for non-pro athletes, keeping their unique goals, fitness levels, and progress in mind. It gives a more accurate reflection of an athlete's efforts and guides their training effectively via gamified training blocks.

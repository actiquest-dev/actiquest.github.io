We're a platform that provides users with rewards for keeping fit, unlocking an additional income stream for participating in their usual exercise activities, or taking part in specific fitness-related challenges. It builds on the trend and success of play-to-earn, where users are rewarded, in cryptocurrency, for playing games.","Actiquest generally aims to incentivize fitness and sport, helping to reduce obesity and sedentariness, and giving users an opportunity to earn an income for improving their health. Indeed, researchers recently found that improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness lead to a significant reduction in all-cause and disease-specific mortality, with an individual’s maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) being strongly correlated with their life expectancy.","The term move-to-earn refers to the possibility of earning valuable rewards while doing activities like moving about, similar to P2E (play-to-earn), which has since been adopted by a variety of other apps that reward users for their activity.","Actiquest generates rewards in the form of blockchain-based digital tokens. Users are rewarded in native utility tokens for completing fitness-related tasks — such as walking, running, or swimming.","Actiquest tracks activity and completion of tasks using the data from a cell phone or fitness tracker. This is assessed to see if it qualifies for rewards. Earned tokens can then either be directly traded for goods and services within the application or sold/traded on an internal marketplace or external exchange for other cryptocurrencies.","AI powered anti-cheat technology will be employed to ensure that only genuine fitness data is taken into account in the reward calculation process."]},{"i":"vision--mission","l":"Vision & Mission"},{"l":"Vision","p":["Innovate better health & lifestyle technology for billions of people by acquiring non-crypto users to the crypto metaverse, where people can connect through fitness and sport activities."]},{"l":"Mission","p":["We will build up an activity-to-earn platform which could be extended with Social-Fi functions, which supports the connection between users and community through exercises such as Cycle, Run, Walk, Workout, Swim, Dance and more to come.

All users' activities are monitored by in-app AI to avoid cheats and fraud. To start your Move to Earn, and mint $ACTI you must purchase any NFT Specialty in mode shops and if you want to get a $QUEST, you’ll need endurance (END). Otherwise you should mint $ACTI more slowly using your sport exercises only.

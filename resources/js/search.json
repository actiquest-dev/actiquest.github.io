Actiq provides adaptable AI coaches on top of Actiq app superior to Human Coaches in realtime data analysis, race day strategy, tailoring and adjusting training plans, and not kidding - personal neutrality, empathy and regular feedback (compare it to weekly calls with human coaches).","Unlike the competition with remote fitness coaches aggregators like Fittr or ML-driven endurance training apps like PKRS.AI and Enduco, our gamified training app revolutionizes athletic training with AI coaches, using deep learning, decision intelligence, tokenized incentives (also managed by AI) and constantly learning LLM for only $20/month."]},{"l":"Fundamentals","p":["In an era where the intersection of technology and sports is creating new frontiers, Actiquest Lab is set to launch a groundbreaking app that redefines athletic coaching.","Demand in sports is significantly growing. Human Sport Coaches are constantly over demanding and limited by design. Actiquest AI technologies will disrupt sport coaching, unlock it for masses and democratizes access to it.","Actiquest Lab is developing multimodal AI for autonomous and constantly learned AI sport coaches (human digital twins) based on a combination of deep learning, decision making, computer vision and generative AI enabled with natural language processing (NLP). The technology allows human coaches to digitize the training process and create AI-twin coaches using mobile app to train athletes remotely. Athletes can hear the AI coach's live recommendations, respond to him during training, make adjustments to the plan, receive rewards based on the results of completing training blocks, and much more. Supported sports: tennis, golf, power training, running, cycling, swimming, yoga, remedial gymnastics, etc.","The main concept of Actiquest AI multimodality is to use seamless data augmentation from CNN like Yolo with generative LLM like GPT to not wait for outperforming results in zero shot scene recognition by general vision enabled LLM's like Google Gemini. Smart-autolabeling of Computer Vision outputs yields 60fps human pose estimation, multiple object tracking and AI decision making at high speed. More about this you can read in our blog article","The Actiq main functionalities include comprehensive athlete omni-coaching path across several sports and tracking athletes during workouts, play sessions, and socialized competitions. All activities within the app are gamified and incentivized, creating a motivating and engaging training environment.","Actiq app collects more complex health data from users. Actiq app provides much more adjustability to our ML models via quality feedback from athletes. We create a comprehensive solution to help athletes prepare for endurance events by combining LLM and AI/ML Computer Vision tools.","Actiq app also records your training results and convert completed training blocks into valuable rewards. You can earn $ACTI token through your performance exercises, hold it or exchange coins for store purchases, physical products, digital collectibles, event tickets, organize real sport events and holder ranking to access features.","Actiq promotes an active lifestyle for its users. You can either hold the tokens to use in-app or cash out for profit. The more you practice, the more rewards you get; that is the motivation that pushes us forward to move our bodies so as to gain beneficial health improvement and control."]},{"l":"Understanding AI Coaches","p":["Access & Affordability. AI coaching tools are often more accessible and affordable than human coaches, allowing a broader range of athletes to benefit from professional coaching.","Actiq generally aims to incentivize fitness and sport, helping to reduce obesity and sedentariness, and giving users an opportunity to reinforce dopaminergic reward system by using tokenized incentives precisely controlled by AI for improving their perfomance. Indeed, researchers recently found that improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness lead to a significant reduction in all-cause and disease-specific mortality, with an individual’s maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) being strongly correlated with their life expectancy.","Actiq generates rewards in the form of blockchain-based digital tokens ($ACTI). Users are rewarded by AI Sport Coach in native utility tokens for completing sport-related training blocks — across most playing and athletic sports (tennis, golf, boxing, padel, running, biking etc.).Exact reward table for each sport will be announced later. As part of the AI by AI program, before the product will be released, a unique incentivizing algorithm will be created while athletes will train AI to earn monetary incentives. That will affect a final part of customer development campaign which is starts in Q2 of 2023 within 200+ thriathletes to help us to validate product and market fit. Also we bridge data from all professional sports applications into one place and give you rewards for tracking user activities. Strava, Zwift, Peloton, RGT and other platforms users can connect their profiles to the Actiquest platform and get $ACTI initial airdrop based on the last 3 month data of imported sport activities.","Actiq tracks activity and completion of training blocks using the any health ecosystem such as Strava, Garmin, Apple Health, Google Fit and Suunto. This is assessed to see by selected AI Coach (we create different coaching characters which are taking in a sense age, style or gender of athlete) if it qualifies for rewards.","AI coaches are always on duty. By implementing GAP (Grade Adjusted Pace) models and robust speech recognition, AI Coaches can create highly adaptive, personal training plans for non-pro athletes, keeping their unique goals, fitness levels, and progress in mind. It gives a more accurate reflection of an athlete's efforts and guides their training effectively via gamified training blocks. AI Coaches are constantly learning from athletes using realistic NLP engine and by processing athlete's health data coming from various sources such as Strava, Google Fit, Garmin Health, etc.","AI coaches are artificial intelligence entities, that uses a combination of computer vision, decision intelligence, set of langchain agents on top of pre-trained LLM with NLP-based voice feedback to interact with athlete during workouts.","AI powered anti-cheat technology will be employed to ensure that only genuine fitness data is taken into account in the reward calculation process. As our algorithms requires more complex communication with athlete, it will be hardly to imitate Humans in multimodal AI environment.","AI will soon outperform Human Coaches and here is why:","Analyzes physical/mental state;","Are adjustable virtual characters;","Availability. Human Coach is lack in 24x7 on demand availability: AI coaches are not restricted by time zones, schedules, or personal commitments. They are available 24/7, providing constant assistance and feedback when required. AI coaches are always on duty.","Consistency. Human Coaches are poor in consistency. AI algorithms don't suffer from typical human bias or mood swings. It will also provide consistent processes based on coaching we train it on. This leads to consistency in coaching, maintaining an unchanging standard of coaching quality.","Constantly adjusts training plan to rise the goals;","Data Analysis. Human Coach is lack in data analysis: One of AI's strong suits is the ability to analyze large sets of data in record time. Unlike human coaches, AI can assess, process, and produce insights from complex health data, augmenting the decision-making process.","In-App AI Coaches:","Long-term tracking. Human Coach definitely looses to AI with athlete’s long-term tracking even using data-rich apps. Tracking progress over extended periods can be challenging for humans. AI, on the other hand, excels in this area, continuously monitoring and adjusting the learning path.","Manages monetary rewards after training completion.","Monitors endurance, tempo, threshold, V02Max and anaerobic parameters;","Personal Neutrality. Human Coaches are not attentive to athletes, even training groups are overcrowded: AI offers unbiased coaching, unaffected by personal biases or emotions that could cloud a human coach's judgment. AI coaches are created to motivate athletes to obtain better results.","Predicts and monitors athlete's performance;","Provides motivated personalized feedback during training blocks","Scalability is not strong side of Human Coaches. AI coaches can accommodate athletes simultaneously, something impossible for individual human coaches. Or at least the vast majority.","Seamless Learning Adaptation. AI has the ability to personalize learning paths based on each athletes needs, adapting in real-time according to latest learnings from coaching and learning sessions. Our AI-learning program constantly improves AI coaches to be superior and adaptive.","TCO. Unfortunately, AI win Humans in economic value. The average cost of one-hour training with tennis coach in US is about $100. AI coaches time is 100 times cheaper compared to Human Coaches. We create AI coaches in different sports that will cost about $20 per month in total and allows to build healthy habits and achieve better workouts performance to everyone."]},{"i":"vision--mission","l":"Vision & Mission"},{"l":"Vision","p":["Innovate better health & lifestyle technology for billions of people by using latest AI developments.

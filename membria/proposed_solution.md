# Proposed Solution

We propose a **Knowledge Cache Graph (KCG)**, an immutable, content-addressable graph of validated knowledge, combined with **Cache-Augmented Generation (CAG)** - a mechanism allowing Tiny LLMs to retrieve distilled knowledge before resorting to expensive LLM inference.

## Components

* **KCG (Knowledge Cache Graph):** A structured graph stored on Arweave/IPFS where each entity, relation, and reasoning chain is immutable and verifiable.
* **CAG (Cache-Augmented Generation):** A generation workflow where Tiny LLMs leverage KCG for fast, low-cost reasoning.
* **DoD Agents (Distillation on Demand):** Autonomous agents that request knowledge from Big LLMs, distill responses, and propose updates to KCG.
* **Federated Gateways:** Trusted nodes managing API access to Big LLMs and handling KCG updates.
* **Community Validators:** Stakeholders who verify the quality of new knowledge entries.

# Overview

Actiq combines on-device AI, distillation-on-demand (DoD), and a decentralized knowledge layer (CAG) to create a fast, private, and evolving intelligence system that learns from user interaction and scales through distributed memory using Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG).

This document outlines the architecture, purpose, and benefits of Cache-Augmented Generation (CAG) and on-demand distillation within the Actiq ecosystem.

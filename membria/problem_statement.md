# Problem Statement

The proliferation of Tiny LLMs, downloaded and run on millions of edge devices, has created a fundamental challenge: hyper-personalization and continuous fine-tuning of these small models is computationally infeasible for most users. Each Tiny LLM faces knowledge gaps, context fragmentation, and high costs associated with maintaining up-to-date, relevant knowledge bases. The current AI ecosystem lacks scalable mechanisms to empower Tiny LLMs with fresh, verified knowledge without constant dependence on cloud-based inference.

EchoLM analysis indicates that 60% of user queries exhibit semantically similar counterparts in historical data.

## Key Challenges

- **Static and outdated models**: Once deployed, Tiny LLMs quickly become stale, as they cannot natively update their knowledge base or integrate new information without retraining.
- **Hyper-personalization** of millions of Tiny LLM instances is unscalable
- **Hallucinated or unverifiable** SLM answers.
- **Costly and centralized fine-tuning**: Existing methods for updating models, such as LoRA or QLoRA fine-tuning, require cloud GPUs, expert intervention, and significant time and money.
- **Dependency on Big LLM APIs**: Users and apps frequently fall back on Big LLM APIs (GPT, Claude, Gemini) to access fresh or complex knowledge, incurring high costs and introducing privacy, latency, and control issues.
- **Absence of a shared, reusable knowledge memory**: Tiny LLMs operate in isolation, lacking access to a federated, verified, and continuously growing knowledge layer they can rely on.
- **No incentive model** for community-driven knowledge distillation.

# Problem Statement

The proliferation of Tiny LLMs, downloaded and run on millions of edge devices, has created a fundamental challenge: hyper-personalization and continuous fine-tuning of these small models is computationally infeasible for most users. Each Tiny LLM faces knowledge gaps, context fragmentation, and high costs associated with maintaining up-to-date, relevant knowledge bases. The current AI ecosystem lacks scalable mechanisms to empower Tiny LLMs with fresh, verified knowledge without constant dependence on cloud-based inference.

EchoLM analysis indicates that 60% of user queries exhibit semantically similar counterparts in historical data.

## Key Challenges

* Hyper-personalization of millions of Tiny LLM instances is unscalable.
* Continuous fine-tuning is resource-intensive and impractical for edge devices.
* High cost and latency of API calls to Big LLMs.
* Hallucinated or unverifiable answers.
* Lack of reusable, validated knowledge caches.
* No incentive model for community-driven knowledge distillation.

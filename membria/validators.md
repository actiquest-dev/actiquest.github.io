# Validators

Validators provide the final layer of trust in Membria, confirming the correctness of knowledge proposals and enforcing network rules through stake-weighted consensus.

## Core Responsibilities
- **Knowledge validation**  
  Review distilled entries submitted by gateways, verify supporting evidence and ensure semantic coherence.
- **Consensus voting**  
  Sign or reject proposals in a stake-weighted quorum; finality is reached when a super-majority of signatures is recorded.
- **Proof-of-Knowledge attestation**  
  Issue cryptographic attestations that bind each accepted entry to its on-chain transaction ID, enabling end-to-end provenance.
- **Dispute resolution**  
  Arbitrate conflicts or appeals when competing claims or malicious submissions arise.

## Staking and Rewards
- Validators lock tokens as collateral; larger stakes grant higher voting power but increase potential loss on misbehavior.
- Successful validation cycles yield block rewards and a share of DoD fees.
- Slashing mechanisms penalize validators who sign fraudulent or low-quality entries.

## Infrastructure Requirements
| Component      | Minimum Spec               | Purpose                             |
|----------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Validation node| 4 vCPU, 8 GB RAM           | Signature aggregation and voting    |
| Light index    | 20 GB SSD                  | Quick access to recent KCG entries  |
| Uptime target  | 99.5 percent               | Maintain quorum availability        |

Nodes do not store full gateway caches, keeping hardware costs modest.

## Governance Role
Validators participate in on-chain voting to adjust:
- Quorum size and signature thresholds  
- Slashing parameters and reward rates  
- Protocol upgrades affecting KCG schemas or cache policies  

This makes them stewards of both technical security and economic health.

## Fraud Detection and Auditing
- Validators run statistical and semantic checks to spot spam or contradictory claims.
- Periodic audits compare validator signatures with historical accuracy scores; repeated errors lower reputation and staking limits.
- All validator actions are logged on-chain, allowing independent review.

## Interaction with Gateways
1. Gateway packages a validated proposal and broadcasts it.  
2. Validators retrieve the package, verify evidence and cast votes.  
3. Once quorum is met, the gateway finalizes the write to KCG.  
4. Validatorsâ€™ signatures become an immutable part of the record.

## Security and Resilience
- Stake-weighted voting discourages Sybil attacks.  
- Rotating committee selection prevents collusion.  
- Slashed stakes are partially burned and partially redistributed to honest validators, reinforcing correct behavior.

Validators thus serve as the cryptographic and economic backbone of Membria, ensuring that only accurate, well-sourced knowledge becomes part of the collective memory.

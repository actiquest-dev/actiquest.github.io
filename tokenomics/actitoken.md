# Tokenomics

## Basics

💫 **ACTI Incentive Token, $ACTI** is a digital currency issued to reward the athletes in achieving feats through sports. Developed by Actiquest Lab, the token leverages state-of-the-art artificial intelligence technology in providing personalized learning across a wide array of sports disciplines. AIGC enables personalized training planning, goal setting, and real-time feedback, allowing the platform to motivate its users toward the attainment of fitness objectives. This is an economy where reward for active lifestyles is paid either as a workout progress or as an ACTI token to be utilized by making in-app purchases.

💎Actiq Wallet is a Telegram mini-app that allows you to earn ACTI by completing social and sports challenges, while also preparing the Actiquest community for the launch of a mobile app in the first quarter of 2025.


## What are $ACTI tokens for? 

Actiq is launching tokenized Web3 incentives ($ACTI ERC20 tokens) for athletes as part of the “AI-​by-AI” (AI Incentives for Athletes) program. The program includes the involvement of the athletes in training of advanced AI models and incentivizing them with $ACTI tokens. 

- Actiq is a blockchain agnostic project, so $ACTI will flow within the TON, ICP, BSC, BASE, and SOL ecosystems. 
- Cross-chain Token Swap: The safe bridges on ICP makes a secure and reliable integration of different networks with ACTI Incentive Ecosystem.

## Athletes can use $ACTI in several ways

- Redeem $ACTI tokens for a subscription to Actiq app
- Redeem $ACTI tokens for in-app purchases
- Redeem $ACTI tokens for discount vouchers from Actiq partners (endurance suppliers, sportswear brands, travel, telecommunications services and many others).
- Put $ACTI in staking (through third party providers).
- Vote in Actiq Sport DAO (to be announced)

## Sustainability of the project's tokenomics

> $ACTI tokenomics do not contain any hidden ponzi schemes and are
> completely unattached to the flow of new users, as it happened in
> StepN previously. We build $ACTI's demand using on-chain and off-chain
> methods that take into account the general interests of sports
> enthusiasts. It also reduces the influence of negative factors such as
> FUD, manipulation, and abnormal price volatility, since ACTI is not
> paired and traded with highly volatile assets. Web3 for a mass
> audience of sports fans is widely adopted. We keep growing and create
> news and achievements within our project.

## Aspects of $ACTI tokenomics aimed at preventing token inflation and reducing its value

- 500M $ACTI HardCap across all ecosystems. New tokens will no longer be issued.
- 50% of all $ACTI are managed by AI as part of the AI ​​by AI incentive program. These tokens are long-vested for 120 months and are released gradually (0.5% of the total supply per month) using a deflationary algorithm that includes the use of fees.
- Every time an athlete uses $ACTI to purchase goods and services, the tokens will be burned through the smart contract function, resulting in a reduction in the total number of tokens in circulation.
- Throughout the token's life cycle, no more than 10% of the total $ACTI supply can be in free circulation, which maintains stability and prevents depreciation.

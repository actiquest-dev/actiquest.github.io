# Roadmap

> Here is Actiquest roadmap in 2024-2025

## Q4-2024 
=== **Development**
- Preparing for Sport Knowledge LLM and Vision Transformer 1000 athletes training program
- Moving from CNN to VIT (based on [Synthmocap](https://microsoft.github.io/SynthMoCap/))
- Moving from VoxelGPT to Llama (based on [LLama Nemotron](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct-HF/))
- Create wizard app for ViT training
- Fine-tuning ViT to recognize the tiniest details of 60 fps sport videos, allowing better recognition of fine motor skills and registering deviations in exercise technique.
- Optimizing ViT to spend fewer resources for training and processing video data (inference, on the phones).
- Modifying D.R.O.C (Dynamic Real-time Objective Correction) model, which allows LLM to make real-time judgments on the quality of exercise performance and correct the athlete's technique. D.R.O.C will instantly detect errors or incorrect movements and give the user feedback, helping them improve their technique without the need for repeated workout reviews or consultations with a coach. That will work as a part of a special RAG over Llama.
=== **Product**
- Custdev + celebrity coaches collaboration: (recruit 200 athletes to help us to train our AI engine during custdev campaign to validate product and market fit + 10 coaches as ambassadors).
- AI by AI program: create Sport Knowledge LLM training app for athletes and coaches to train AI and be incentivized with $ACTI (alpha version of Actiq app) – running when token will be listed.
- Run $ACTICAT – meme coin to promote first AIGC character (https://acticat.xyz ) + ACTI airdrop to $ACTICAT investors.

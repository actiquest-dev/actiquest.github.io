**📘 Actiq CAG + DoD Architecture — Public Documentation Draft**

---

### Overview

Actiq combines on-device AI, distillation-on-demand (DoD), and a decentralized knowledge layer (CAG) to create a fast, private, and evolving intelligence system that learns from user interaction and scales through distributed memory.

This document outlines the architecture, purpose, and benefits of Cache-Augmented Generation (CAG) and on-demand distillation within the Actiq ecosystem.

### 🔍 What is CAG (Cache-Augmented Generation)?

CAG replaces traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with a pre-computed, immutable cache of distilled knowledge blocks. These blocks are embedded directly into prompts or fine-tuning datasets for tiny LLMs, enabling:

* Faster response times (no retrieval delay)
* Higher consistency and relevance
* Seamless integration with local and decentralized storage

Unlike RAG, which relies on a live search through a vector database at inference time, CAG uses previously curated and verified QA pairs (or micro-knowledge units) stored in a globally accessible layer. These are:

* Distilled from trusted LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Claude)
* Filtered for relevance, safety, and clarity
* Stored on decentralized infrastructure like Arweave
* Signed and tagged with metadata for future reuse

CAG functions as a **shared knowledge memory** that many devices and agents can draw from without needing repeated cloud queries or retrieval cycles. This dramatically reduces latency, cost, and reliance on central infrastructure.

### 🔁 What is DoD (Distillation-on-Demand)?

DoD is the process of selectively querying large cloud models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) only when the on-device model lacks confidence. The returned response is then:

1. Returned to the user in real time
2. Saved to a permanent knowledge cache (CAG)
3. Used to improve the local model via distillation or tuning

This feedback loop lets Actiq devices improve continuously without over-relying on cloud inference.

---

### 🧠 Knowledge Cache Layer (Arweave)

Actiq stores verified QA blocks on Arweave — a permanent, decentralized data layer — making these distilled insights:

* Publicly auditable and accessible
* Cost-efficient (one-time cost \~\$0.000006 per QA block)
* Syncable across devices without duplication

The cache layer acts as a **collective intelligence memory**, with contributions from many users and devices. Each entry is:

* Hashed and signed by its origin device
* Labeled with source LLM, tags, and optional confidence rating
* Optionally rated by the community or private to device

Access can be:

* Open/public (global common knowledge)
* Permissioned (team, project, product)
* Private (device-only cache)

### ⚙️ Local Architecture Flow

```plaintext
[User prompt] → [Tiny model answers]
     ↓
[If confidence low]
     ↓
→ [Query Cloud LLM (DoD)]
     ↓
→ [Answer returned + saved to Arweave (CAG)]
     ↓
→ [Local distillation / LoRA update]
     ↓
→ [Future prompts use CAG context directly]
```

---

### 💡 Why This Matters

* **Private by design**: Personal context stays local; shared knowledge is anonymized and distilled
* **Efficient**: Reduces cloud cost and latency by over 80%
* **Decentralized**: Each user contributes to and benefits from a shared intelligence layer
* **Scalable**: CAG can support millions of edge nodes without bloated cloud infra

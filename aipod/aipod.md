## Description

The **AI Live Pod** is a state-of-the-art portable coaching device designed to revolutionize fitness, sports, music, and learning by leveraging cutting-edge AI, VR/AR, and decentralized technology. Below, we provide links to visual representations and detailed use cases to showcase its capabilities.

1. A sleek, portable design optimized for mobility and usability in various environments.

2.  VR180 6K HDR 60 fps motion capture and depth metadata using LiDAR sensor. Combination of several AI vision methods allows to capture high-quality 3D realtime reconstruction of the complete human body, including eyes, mimic, tongue and hands, without requiring any calibration and manual intervention.

> Motion-capture technology used in film and game production typically focuses only on face, body, and hand capture independently, involves complex and costly hardware, and requires significant manual intervention.  Even though machine-learning techniques exist to overcome these problems, they typically only support a single camera, often operate on a single body part, are not precise in world space, and rarely generalize outside a specified context.

 
3. AR/VR Integration ready

- Deploys captured biomechanics data to immersive AR and VR platforms and applications in realtime.

## Description

The **AI Live Pod** is a state-of-the-art portable coaching device designed to revolutionize fitness, sports, music, and learning by leveraging cutting-edge AI, VR/AR, and decentralized technology. Below, we provide links to visual representations and detailed use cases to showcase its capabilities.

1. A sleek, portable design optimized for mobility and usability in various environments.

2.  VR180 6K HDR 60 fps motion capture and depth metadata using LiDAR sensor. Combination of several AI vision methods allows to capture high-quality 3D realtime reconstruction of the complete human body, including eyes, mimic, tongue and hands, without requiring any calibration and manual intervention.

> Motion-capture technology used in film and game production typically focuses only on face, body, and hand capture independently, involves complex and costly hardware, and requires significant manual intervention.  Even though machine-learning techniques exist to overcome these problems, they typically only support a single camera, often operate on a single body part, are not precise in world space, and rarely generalize outside a specified context.

 
3. AR/VR Integration ready

- Deploys captured biomechanics data to immersive AR and VR platform and applications.

## Indoor and Outdoor Mode

  
The **AI Live Pod** features a physical switch on the top of the device that allows seamless toggling between indoor and outdoor modes. This switch adjusts the camera angles to suit the respective environment:

 
### Indoor Mode

- The cameras are configured in a **stereo pair** setup, ideal for close-range tracking and depth perception.

- This mode is optimized for personal workouts, providing real-time feedback and tracking user movements with precision.


### Outdoor Mode

- The cameras are positioned **160 degrees apart**, enabling wide-angle coverage to automatically follow actions on the field.

- Designed for sports events, this mode creates a **broadcast-like experience** by tracking players and activities dynamically.

- Users can **live-stream games**, watch recordings immediately after the event, and bookmark crucial moments for later review.


## Spatial Audio

- Showcases the Harman Kardon Spatial 3D Audio system for immersive sound. Allows to precisely synchronize audio with video positioned, transmitted from AI pod to TV.

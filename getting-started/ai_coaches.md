_Opposed to humanoid robots from _Will Smith starring Sci-Fi thriller “I Robot”_, cat-like AIGC character design could make the whole process of learning and training more fun-less intimidating. Optimus robots, Cybercab robo-taxis, and Robovan buses were completely inspired by this film, which means that the marketing of robotic innovations is surprisingly predictable.

Why a cat? Humanoid robots sometimes fall into an "uncanny valley" where they are almost human but with subtle differences that are disquieting. The virtual cat character avoids this problem in its entirety by taking on a very non-human form that is universally attractive and non-threatening. People have a natural affection for animals, cats especially. This helps, in some cases, to work out a sense of camaraderie and, therefore, motivation to make the workout experience more comfortable.

It is possible to attribute a personality to ACTIcat, adapting it to different age ranges, sports, and forms of training in such a way that the AI will adapt to different users' needs.

Thus, it might be that athletes get emotionally tied with the sweet and friendly AIGC; hence, commitment to the training program increases. Therefore, with this, it will keep them more motivated by sticking to your exercise schedule.

Unlike aggregators that offered remote classes with human fitness trainers, such as Fittr-which came during Covid times, or applications leveraging machine learning in endurance training apps like PKRS.AI and Enduco, Actiq's multimodal AI changes the game in sports training, taking on several at once.

AIGC always stays in touch with you. Using the Grade Adapted Pace model with a strong feature of speech recognition, the AIGCs develop extremely adaptable, personalized training plans for sports enthusiasts according to their particular goals, fitness level, and progress. This would better reflect the effort of the athlete and guide their training effectively through the use of game-based training blocks. AIGC continuously learns from the athletes through the processing of health data originating from a range of sources, such as Strava, Google Fit, Garmin Health, among others.

### AIGC in 8 bullets (to avoid a long read):

- User-configurable virtual characters;
- Predicts and monitors training outcomes;
- Analyzes physical/mental state;
- Provides motivated, personalized feedback within training blocks.
- Sees the trainee using 60fps ViT and estimates the quality visually .
- Constantly readjusts the training plan by set goals;
- Tracks endurance, pace, threshold, V02Max, and anaerobic parameters;
- Manages monetary rewards upon completion of training blocks and quests.


## Can AIGCs coach better than humans?
_AIGC will soon surpass human sport coaches, and here's why:_

**Data Analysis:** Human trainers are unable to analyze large amounts of data as fast as AI would. Probably one of the main advantages of AI is high speed in processing and analyzing big volumes of complex data about the health status of athletes to make better decisions and improve the process of training.

**Availability.** Unlike human trainers, who are restricted to their personal time and schedules, AIGCs don't need breaks or days off. At any moment, whichever the time zone or other restrictions, they are available, providing necessary support or feedback continuously. AI trainers are always in touch to help.

**Subsequence.** The human factor is reflected in the stability of the training process: human coaches may be in different moods, have biases, or other subjective factors. AI overcomes these shortcomings by offering a consistent coaching approach based on rigorous algorithms. This means that the quality of your training will always be consistent.

**Long-term tracking:** AI has surpassed the capabilities of human coaches in tracking athlete performance over time. It still proves hard for a human even with the use of modern applications in data management. AI is constantly analyzing and adapting the training procedure with long-term data that shifts the athlete better toward his goals.

**Scalability**. AI coaches can work with as many athletes at one time as an individual wishes, which is impossible for human coaches working one-on-one or with groups. That is why AI has become an indistinguishable tool in mass coaching.

**Flexibility**. AI can make the training programs personalized to the needs of each athlete. The immediacy with which AI adapts in real time, based on the changing new data inputs, is second to none. AI by AI Program in a part of decentralized AI model training will continuously enhance AIGC’s into state-of-the-art, adaptive, and effective in any environment.

**Neutrality**. AICGs have no personal biases and psychological factors that can influence human trainers' decisions. That is to say, there is an objective approach towards training: every athlete is treated on an equal footing, being effectively motivated to achieve whatever they aim to.

**Availability**. AI sport coaching is usually more accessible and cheaper as compared to classes with human coaches. This offers a chance of professional coaching to more beginner athletes.

**Economic accessibility**. That is an economical benefit for AI as well. For example, an hour's training with a tennis coach costs on average US$100, while services of the AI coach are 100 times cheaper. A subscription for AI coaches in different sports will cost about $20 per month, which will allow everyone to develop healthy habits and achieve high results.

## AIGC in a nutshell (backend side)

### Vision Transformers

**Sports-related CV models running on mobile devices, CDN Distributed, open source, decentralized. Applied technologies: modified NAS Yolo Pose. Now migrating to "Sapiens" ViT)** 

**Vision Transformers (ViT)** allow us to analyze users' movements during training with high accuracy and a speed of 60fps. ViT models work on the principle of transformers and are fully integrated into language models. They divide the image into small areas (patches) and process them using attention mechanisms. This makes it possible to more effectively recognize complex movements and postures of athletes;

- ViT can more efficiently  process raw video on user devices than convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that are typically used in computer vision systems.
- ViT can recognize complex sequences of athlete movements. This is especially useful for improving exercise technique in real time, offering users more accurate and personalized recommendations from an AI coach.
- ViT can recognize the smallest details in images, allowing for better recognition of fine motor skills and recording deviations in exercise technique. For example, the slightest deviations in tennis or gymnastics can negatively affect the final results (in competitions).
- ViT requires less resources for training and video processing (output). The video no longer needs to be uploaded to the server, and the entire process of interaction between the Athlete and the AI ​​occurs in real time. This way, our AI will be able to process videos directly on users' devices, reducing the wait time between completing exercises and receiving recommendations.

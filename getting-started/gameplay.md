# Gameplay

## Single Mode

### General description
Users start the exact activity mode to collect tokens: Cycle, Run, Walk, Workout, Swim, Dance. Each type of activity uses a specific activity-to-earn algorithm to mint $ACTI based on a combination of heart rate, track length, steps and speed data. 
All users' activities are monitored by in-app AI to avoid cheats and fraud. To start your Move to Earn, and mint $ACTI you must purchase any NFT Specialty in mode shops and if you want to get a $QUEST, you’ll need endurance (END). Otherwise you should mint $ACTI more slowly using your sport exercises only.
Every 1 END is equivalent to 5 minutes of your moving, and only once you have done your NFT specialty purchasing. 

### NFT specialty samples:
**Cycle marketplace:** bikes, handlebars, frames, seats, helmets, forks, upgrades etc.
**Run marketplace:** sneakers, socks, gloves, apparel, accessories, bags and more.

**NFT chests:** (geoquest achievements) on track. Users can collect special NFT Items while completing performance tasks on the track. This allows them to increase END value and generate more $ACTI lifetime. 

**NFT chest specialty items:** drinks, energy boosters, collectibles etc. To collect chest items, users should perform a simple task: while located in the geofencing position where the chest exists, take a selfie and make a special pose which can be recognized by in-app AI.

**Floating:** Due to the loss/ weakness of your GPS/ Internet connection or the user is not moving properly, this will be shown which leads to the END losing (depends on the cases) and no QUEST earnings.

**GPS Signal:** no GPS with White, Poor GPS with red and green illustrates a capable GPS Signal.

**NFT breeding:** If a user is active in multi modes, for example: cycling + running in the same time period (day) it allows to breed all collected NFTs and collect more $ACTI/QUEST tokens.

!!!success Note: Always be aware of your END before taking any physical movements because you can’t earn any tokens without it. There are four main factors of $ACTI/QUEST compensation:

1. **ACTI minting algorithm.** Each game mode is quite specific to mint $ACTI and depends on a combination of heart rate, track length, steps and speed data managed by AI. Every new level you train with Actiquest you should show better results to get more $ACTI. Your profit will drop by up to 90% if you slip outside of range (this also depends on the difference in speed with range) f.e. your bike speed will be over 30 kmph on the highland/rugged track.
2. **NFT sport specialty item.** Each item will help you obtain a different amount of $ACTI/QUEST. You can read more about the individual breakdown of each item in the NFT Properties Section. More items - more $ACTI/QUEST, but remember that END (endurance) required to be restored. END will be generated at a rate of 25% every 6 hours after NFT purchasing. (Fixed at UTC Time 00:00, 06:00, 12:00, 18:00) After the first 25% END restore the new QUEST tokens start to generate.
3. **Attributes of NFT Performance.** The higher the performance, the more QUEST per min you can obtain. From level 0-29, users can only achieve QUEST, but at level 30 and above, users can choose either $ACTI or $QUEST. Users are free to control the transition between these two monetization modes.

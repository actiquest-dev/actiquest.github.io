## This Q&A will help you understand what Actiq is in a nutshell

### How does Actiq plan to foster community-driven AI training? What is the DAO’s role in model training, and how does Actiq ensure high-quality contributions?

> We are working to bring the AI revolution into sports. The Sports
> Knowledge LLM will support all forms of sports that mankind has ever
> invented. Sport knowledge is needed by the superior Computer Vision
> component for recognizing human body movement in great detail at a
> high frame rate, outperforming human vision. By seamlessly integrating
> real-world data from wearables, computer vision through reasoning
> intelligence, and instant voice feedback from athletes, we can create
> AI sport coaching agents that are much like humans and give
> comprehensive insight into an athlete's performance.
  
Key advantages include:  
  
1. **Real-time multi-modal data convergence** of CV and wearables with human feedback for multi-angle data analysis by AI.  
2. **Seamless wearables integration.** AI is stitched into all existing health data providers and works in the background.  
3. Vision Transformers: Technology for the Computer Vision part that outperforms CNNs in body posture/movement patterns recognition at 60 fps and can run live on an athlete's smartphone in real time.  
4. **Intelligent Coaching and Feedback.** The multimodal approach employs AI for personal feedback with actionable insight during training sessions. For instance, if an athlete's form breaks down on a particular move, the vision transformer acts with data from wearables to detect just that, and it will suggest changes on the spot for the athlete to adjust and improve on the spot.  
5. **Adaptability and Customization.** Actiquest Sport AI can support the adaptation of different sports and training needs by changing its parameters of tracking, hence becoming very versatile. It will be able to offer various levels of skills and intensities, therefore giving customized feedback that would be relevant in the performance of the user and in the achievement of his goals.
   
### How does Actiq's AI differentiate between sports (e.g., tennis vs. cricket)? Are there unique coaching techniques or tailored feedback loops for each sport?

> Special pre-trained CV models and sport-specific data models stored in
> Sport Knowledge LLM help Actiquest AI identify the differences in
> sports, along with specific health data models collected directly from
> wearables.
1. **Customized Vision Transformer models.** ViT is trained for identifying certain forms and movements which differ from one sport to another. For tennis, this would be tracking the racket's path in swings and the center of gravity by swing and foot placement. In cricket, these aspects come down to the trajectory of the bat, the stability of the stance, and the precision of bowling actions. In each sport, different visual elements receive primary concentration so that AI can follow critical movement differences. We commence training of ViT on 1,000 athletes within a few sports parallel.  
2. **Sport-specific wearable data analysis.** Actiq captures relevant metrics using wearables depending on the demands of the sport. In tennis, these could be lateral speed of movement, racket swing speed, and wrist flexibility, while in cricket, wearables may track arm rotation during bowling, the angles of batting, and running dynamics.3. Adaptive Training Plans: Ours AI gives sport-specific training recommendations-agility drills for tennis players to improve court coverage, or strength and flexibility routines for bowlers in cricket, for example. These adaptive plans respond to each athlete's performance, making sure they're training the exact skills needed to excel in their sport.  
4. **Real-Time, Contextual Coaching.** AI automatically detects any context-specific actions during live training. It suggests making those necessary changes mid-swing or mid-serve for tennis and coaching the bowler to adjust arm angles or the batsman to change the stance based on the observed technique in cricket. The real-time feedback raises the quality of the training by addressing sport-specific needs of that very moment.

### What types of data does Actiq’s AI collect from users? Is there a system in place to ensure privacy and consent for wearable and health data collection?

> *The Actiquest AI collects a wide range of data to provide a very detailed analysis of the athletic performance, focusing on metrics
> that enhance training feedback.*
 
Types of Data Collected:  
  
1. **Biometric Data.** These include heart rate, respiration rate, which are gathered through wearable sensors in order to monitor an athlete's physical exertion and recovery.  
2. **Movement and Positional Information.** Sensors and cameras observe the travel of the body, joint angles, and posture to assess the technique. In tennis, for instance, it may involve tracking arm angles and position of the wrist during a swing.
3. **Environmental Data:** Temperature, humidity, and even altitude may be tracked as an insight into how external conditions affect performance.  
4. **Performance Metrics.** Actiq collects metrics such as speed, acceleration, and agility that are useful for an athlete to monitor improvement in core areas of performance over time.
5. **Personal Health Data.** If consented to, further health information-injury history, flexibility levels, and fatigue markers-can also be included in order to further tailor training routines.

### Can you explain the role of the vision transformers in Actiq’s AI? How do they enable real-time visual feedback for sports movements at 60-fps speed?
> *Vision transformers enables real-time, high-precision full body
> tracking and precise near to rel-time feedback of movements in sports.*
1.  **Attention Mechanism.** Other than traditional CNNs that usually analyze fixed regions of an image, vision transformers make use of an attention mechanism that allows them to selectively focus their attention on crucial areas such as the position of limbs or equipment like a tennis racket without necessarily having to analyze the whole frame. This is important in sports because subtle movements may be indicative of technique or form.  
2. **3D Body Pose Capture.** The transformer architectures of vision are trained for tracking full-body motion capture, detailed face mechanics, and even fingers to achieve highly accurate pose estimation in real time without any specific camera calibration.  
3. **Frame-by-Frame Consistency:** The vision transformers ensure that AI tracks fast movements smoothly while processing every frame at 60 fps. Each frame is matched against its predecessors to trace changes in position or technique, hence allowing the AI to track an athlete's real-time motion without lag. This continuous tracking stands out as the key to providing fluid, uninterrupted feedback.

### How does the Actiq AI adapt to different fitness levels? Does it adjust goals and training plans based on the user’s progress, and how is this measured?
> *Actiq AI is designed to adapt dynamically to an athlete’s fitness level, tailoring goals and training plans to their unique capabilities
> and progress.*  
1. **Initial Assessment.** When a new user starts, Actiq AI conducts an initial assessment based on baseline metrics like endurance, strength, flexibility, and any sport-specific skills.

3. **Adaptive Difficulty Scaling.** The AI monitors real-time metrics such as heart rate, power output, and fatigue indicators to adjust the intensity of exercises during workouts. For instance, if the AI detects the user struggling to maintain form, it can reduce the intensity of a particular drill, or if the user is handling exercises easily, it can increase difficulty to keep workouts challenging.  
4. **Progress Tracking Metrics.** AI measures various metrics to gauge an athlete’s improvement over time:
	- *Performance Metrics:* Speed, strength, agility, endurance, and specific skill indicators are tracked. If an athlete consistently hits target speeds or reps, the AI recognizes this as improvement.
	- *Form and Technique:* Using vision transformers, the AI tracks movement quality, identifying improvements in form. If an athlete’s technique becomes smoother and more precise, this is logged as progress.
	- *Recovery and Fatigue Levels:* Actiq also monitors how quickly athletes recover between exercises and their fatigue levels over the session. Faster recovery times indicate improved fitness.
5. **Weekly and Monthly Goal Adjustments.** Based on these metrics, Actiq adjusts training goals on a weekly or monthly basis. For example:
	- *Beginner to Intermediate Progression:* If a beginner improves their endurance and basic strength, Actiq may introduce more complex exercises or increase the volume of work, pushing them into an intermediate training plan.
	- *Skill Refinement for Advanced Users:* For advanced athletes, Actiq refines and intensifies drills targeting technique, speed, or endurance, continually evolving the program to avoid plateaus.
6. **Feedback Loop and Goal Realignment.** Actiq incorporates a feedback loop to refine training plans as users progress. It recognizes when athletes consistently hit or exceed targets and realigns goals accordingly, ensuring they remain challenging and aligned with the athlete’s growth.
7. **Goal Variability Based on User Preferences.** Actiq allows users to set specific goals, such as strength or agility improvements, and adapts the training plan to emphasize those areas.

### What is the upside of the token? Why do people want to buy and hold $ACTI instead of buying low and selling high?
> *When we mentioned abstract "people" we need to differentiate who they are. There's no significant value to hold for crypto traders at
> the market except early BTC holders at the monent. Nobody's hold any
> altcoins in long-term. All values of $ACTI are primarily for Actiq app
> users. It allows:*

### How will Actiq ensure a smooth transition from Telegram Wallet to the full app experience? Are there specific timelines or user testing stages planned for this?
The Telegram wallet will remain one of the channels for acquiring new users in the EMEA region. In the US, we will use a different approach. Wallet functionality will be extended with many web3 functions (similar to Web3 Dashboard) when the mobile app is released in Q1 2025. In order to sponsor the first bunch of app installations, we plan to run an early app onboarding campaign in Actiq Wallet.

### Are there plans to expand the range of sports or introduce advanced coaching features? If so, are there specific sports or features the team is targeting?
Actiq has step by step plans to expand the range of sports supported on its platform and introduce advanced coaching features. We start with a most popular sports in the markets (tennis and golf) and expands with one's which is most significant for specific markets we target, such us cricket for India.  
  
**Expansion of Supported Sports:**  
- **Endurance Sports.** Actiq plans to introduce more tailored features for endurance-based sports like running, cycling, and swimming. These features may include metrics for pace, cadence, heart rate zones, and recovery tracking to help athletes improve endurance and manage training loads effectively.  
- **Strength and Power Sports.** For users in strength sports like weightlifting, CrossFit, and bodybuilding, Actiq aims to add specialized coaching on form, power output, and muscle engagement. Vision transformers will be leveraged to monitor and correct form in real-time, ensuring safe and effective strength training.  
- **Skill-Based Sports.** Sports with high skill requirements, such as tennis, martial arts, and basketball, are also on Actiq’s radar. Features like real-time swing analysis for tennis, punch/kick tracking for martial arts, and shooting technique for basketball would provide sport-specific guidance to help athletes refine techniques.  
  
**Advanced Coaching Features in Development**  
- **Real-Time Form and Technique Correction.** Actiq is working on refining its AI to provide even more granular, sport-specific feedback. For example, in tennis, the AI might analyze grip, swing arc, and foot placement. In weightlifting, it could monitor joint angles and movement speed to prevent injuries and optimize performance.  
- **Biomechanics and Motion Analysis.** Advanced motion analysis features are in development, which will break down complex movements into individual components, such as knee alignment, hip rotation, and shoulder stability. This level of detail helps athletes in sports like golf, gymnastics, or sprinting improve their form and efficiency.  
- **Dynamic Goal-Setting and Progression Tracking.** Future updates will include adaptive goal-setting that adjusts based on the user’s recent performance and fatigue levels, providing personalized recommendations to avoid overtraining and encourage gradual progression.  
- **Enhanced Recovery Metrics.** Actiq plans to incorporate more in-depth recovery tracking, including metrics such as heart rate variability (HRV), sleep analysis, and stress monitoring. These insights help athletes optimize training cycles and reduce injury risk, especially for sports with high physical demands.

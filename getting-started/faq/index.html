    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<blockquote>
<p>Actiq is a state-of-the-art super app for all sports fans, which opens completely new perspectives in mastering
various types of sports (tennis, padel, cricket, baseball, etc). The application is powered by the latest
developments in Artificial Intelligence Gamified Coach (AIGC) technology and enhanced with web3 based train2earn
mechanics. This has never happened before (Sport Knowledge AI that can incentivize athletes). New users in the sports
industry are going to come into crypto space, both coaches and sport lovers. Competitors include Web2 tracking apps
without AI and rewards tools (Strava) or M2E apps like StepN, which have a lower impact on sports and wellness.
Secondary we&#x27;re solving problem of decentralized ownership of AI models stored on blockchain and distributing the
value of AI inference via DAO which is important for expanding horizons of AI &amp; Web3 synergy.</p>

    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<blockquote>
<p>We are working to bring the AI revolution into sports. The Sports
Knowledge LLM will support all forms of sports that mankind has ever
invented. Sport knowledge is needed by the superior Computer Vision
component for recognizing human body movement in great detail at a
high frame rate, outperforming human vision. By seamlessly integrating
real-world data from wearables, computer vision through reasoning
intelligence, and instant voice feedback from athletes, we can create
AI sport coaching agents that are much like humans and give
comprehensive insight into an athlete&#x27;s performance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Key advantages include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Real-time multi-modal data convergence</strong> of CV and wearables with human feedback for multi-angle data analysis by AI.</li>
<li><strong>Seamless wearables integration.</strong> AI is stitched into all existing health data providers and works in the background.</li>

        <span>How does Actiq&#x27;s AI differentiate between sports (e.g., tennis vs. cricket)? Are there unique coaching techniques or tailored feedback loops for each sport?</span>
    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<blockquote>
<p>Special pre-trained CV models and sport-specific data models stored in
Sport Knowledge LLM help Actiquest AI identify the differences in
sports, along with specific health data models collected directly from
wearables.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>Customized Vision Transformer models.</strong> ViT is trained for identifying certain forms and movements which differ from one sport to another. For tennis, this would be tracking the racket&#x27;s path in swings and the center of gravity by swing and foot placement. In cricket, these aspects come down to the trajectory of the bat, the stability of the stance, and the precision of bowling actions. In each sport, different visual elements receive primary concentration so that AI can follow critical movement differences. We commence training of ViT on 1,000 athletes within a few sports parallel.</li>
<li><strong>Sport-specific wearable data analysis.</strong> Actiq captures relevant metrics using wearables depending on the demands of the sport. In tennis, these could be lateral speed of movement, racket swing speed, and wrist flexibility, while in cricket, wearables may track arm rotation during bowling, the angles of batting, and running dynamics.3. Adaptive Training Plans: Ours AI gives sport-specific training recommendations-agility drills for tennis players to improve court coverage, or strength and flexibility routines for bowlers in cricket, for example. These adaptive plans respond to each athlete&#x27;s performance, making sure they&#x27;re training the exact skills needed to excel in their sport.</li>
<li><strong>Real-Time, Contextual Coaching.</strong> AI automatically detects any context-specific actions during live training. It suggests making those necessary changes mid-swing or mid-serve for tennis and coaching the bowler to adjust arm angles or the batsman to change the stance based on the observed technique in cricket. The real-time feedback raises the quality of the training by addressing sport-specific needs of that very moment.</li>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The Actiquest AI collects a wide range of data to provide a very detailed analysis of the athletic performance, focusing on metrics
that enhance training feedback.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Types of Data Collected:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Biometric Data.</strong> These include heart rate, respiration rate, which are gathered through wearable sensors in order to monitor an athlete&#x27;s physical exertion and recovery.</li>
<li><strong>Movement and Positional Information.</strong> Sensors and cameras observe the travel of the body, joint angles, and posture to assess the technique. In tennis, for instance, it may involve tracking arm angles and position of the wrist during a swing.</li>
<li><strong>Environmental Data:</strong> Temperature, humidity, and even altitude may be tracked as an insight into how external conditions affect performance.</li>
<li><strong>Performance Metrics.</strong> Actiq collects metrics such as speed, acceleration, and agility that are useful for an athlete to monitor improvement in core areas of performance over time.</li>
<li><strong>Personal Health Data.</strong> If consented to, further health information-injury history, flexibility levels, and fatigue markers-can also be included in order to further tailor training routines.</li>

        <span>Can you explain the role of the vision transformers in Actiq’s AI? How do they enable real-time visual feedback for sports movements at 60-fps speed?</span>
    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Vision transformers enables real-time, high-precision full body
tracking and precise near to rel-time feedback of movements in sports.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>Attention Mechanism.</strong> Other than traditional CNNs that usually analyze fixed regions of an image, vision transformers make use of an attention mechanism that allows them to selectively focus their attention on crucial areas such as the position of limbs or equipment like a tennis racket without necessarily having to analyze the whole frame. This is important in sports because subtle movements may be indicative of technique or form.</li>
<li><strong>3D Body Pose Capture.</strong> The transformer architectures of vision are trained for tracking full-body motion capture, detailed face mechanics, and even fingers to achieve highly accurate pose estimation in real time without any specific camera calibration.</li>
<li><strong>Frame-by-Frame Consistency:</strong> The vision transformers ensure that AI tracks fast movements smoothly while processing every frame at 60 fps. Each frame is matched against its predecessors to trace changes in position or technique, hence allowing the AI to track an athlete&#x27;s real-time motion without lag. This continuous tracking stands out as the key to providing fluid, uninterrupted feedback.</li>

        <span>How does the Actiq AI adapt to different fitness levels? Does it adjust goals and training plans based on the user’s progress, and how is this measured?</span>
    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Actiq AI is designed to adapt dynamically to an athlete’s fitness level, tailoring goals and training plans to their unique capabilities
and progress.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>Initial Assessment.</strong> When a new user starts, Actiq AI conducts an initial assessment based on baseline metrics like endurance, strength, flexibility, and any sport-specific skills. This helps the AI understand the athlete&#x27;s current fitness level, setting a foundation for personalized training.</li>
<li><strong>Customized Training Goals.</strong> Based on the initial assessment, Actiq creates goals that match the user’s abilities. For a beginner, the focus might be on building foundational strength and form, while an advanced athlete might receive more specialized goals like refining technique or increasing speed.</li>
<li><strong>Adaptive Difficulty Scaling.</strong> The AI monitors real-time metrics such as heart rate, power output, and fatigue indicators to adjust the intensity of exercises during workouts. For instance, if the AI detects the user struggling to maintain form, it can reduce the intensity of a particular drill, or if the user is handling exercises easily, it can increase difficulty to keep workouts challenging.</li>
<li><strong>Progress Tracking Metrics.</strong> AI measures various metrics to gauge an athlete’s improvement over time:
<ul>
<li><em>Performance Metrics:</em> Speed, strength, agility, endurance, and specific skill indicators are tracked. If an athlete consistently hits target speeds or reps, the AI recognizes this as improvement.</li>
<li><em>Form and Technique:</em> Using vision transformers, the AI tracks movement quality, identifying improvements in form. If an athlete’s technique becomes smoother and more precise, this is logged as progress.</li>
<li><em>Recovery and Fatigue Levels:</em> Actiq also monitors how quickly athletes recover between exercises and their fatigue levels over the session. Faster recovery times indicate improved fitness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Weekly and Monthly Goal Adjustments.</strong> Based on these metrics, Actiq adjusts training goals on a weekly or monthly basis. For example:
<ul>
<li><em>Beginner to Intermediate Progression:</em> If a beginner improves their endurance and basic strength, Actiq may introduce more complex exercises or increase the volume of work, pushing them into an intermediate training plan.</li>
<li><em>Skill Refinement for Advanced Users:</em> For advanced athletes, Actiq refines and intensifies drills targeting technique, speed, or endurance, continually evolving the program to avoid plateaus.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Feedback Loop and Goal Realignment.</strong> Actiq incorporates a feedback loop to refine training plans as users progress. It recognizes when athletes consistently hit or exceed targets and realigns goals accordingly, ensuring they remain challenging and aligned with the athlete’s growth.</li>
<li><strong>Goal Variability Based on User Preferences.</strong> Actiq allows users to set specific goals, such as strength or agility improvements, and adapts the training plan to emphasize those areas. This flexibility ensures the AI aligns with the user’s personal fitness objectives while still providing comprehensive, balanced training.</li>

        <span>How are training data and AI models managed and stored within the ICP-based DAO? Are there safeguards in place to maintain the models&#x27; integrity and security?</span>
    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Within Actiq&#x27;s Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)-based DAO, training data and open-source Sport AI models are managed and stored through a
decentralized and secure infrastructure, leveraging the ICP’s
blockchain and distributed storage capabilities.Here are the
features:</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>Distributed Data Storage.</strong> The ICP offers decentralized storage through canisters (smart contracts) that store both training data and model parameters across multiple nodes. This distribution prevents a single point of failure, ensuring data resilience and accessibility across the network.</li>
<li><strong>Version-Controlled Model Management.</strong> AI models within the ICP-based DAO are version-controlled, meaning each iteration of the model is stored separately and accessible for tracking changes or reverting updates if necessary. This helps maintain a transparent history of model development, allowing the community to audit changes and understand the evolution of each model.</li>
<li><strong>Voting Mechanisms for Model Updates.</strong> The DAO leverages ICP’s consensus protocol to validate and authorize updates to AI models. Before any model modification or new training data is integrated, a voting process ensures community approval, protecting the model’s integrity against unauthorized changes.</li>
<li><strong>Immutable Audit Trails.</strong> Each change to the training data or AI models is logged on the ICP blockchain, creating an immutable audit trail. This traceability allows the DAO to track the source and details of each contribution, improving accountability and fostering trust within the community.</li>
<li><strong>Quality-Controlled Data Submission.</strong> Community members submit training data that goes through a validation process, where other DAO members or validators review it for accuracy and relevance before it’s incorporated into the model. This peer-reviewed approach ensures only high-quality data enters the model training pipeline.</li>
<li><strong>Expert Oversight for Critical Model Updates.</strong> For major model changes, the DAO may involve experts or designated reviewers to validate and approve updates. This extra layer of oversight helps prevent low-quality or erroneous data from influencing the AI’s performance.</li>
<li><strong>Transparent Governance Framework.</strong> The DAO’s governance framework includes rules for data submission, model updates, and emergency rollback protocols. This governance ensures that models remain aligned with community goals and that the quality of training data is consistently high.</li>
<li><strong>Backup and Recovery for decentralized CDN</strong>. ICP’s distributed storage architecture inherently offers data redundancy, which means that training data and AI models are backed up across multiple nodes. This resilience ensures model continuity even in the event of node failures or other disruptions.</li>

        <span><a href="https://docs.actiq.xyz/#competitors">Who are Actiq competitors (top 3)</a></span>
    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Here’s an overview of Actiq’s top three competitors in the AI-driven fitness and wellness space, what they’re building, and how Actiq’s
unique approach gives it a competitive edge:</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Freeletics</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>What They’re Building:</em> Freeletics offers an AI-powered fitness app focused on high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and bodyweight exercises. They provide personalized workout plans, adaptive coaching, and video demonstrations. The app emphasizes building fitness with minimal equipment, making it accessible for users training at home or outdoors.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>How They’re Doing It:</em> Freeletics uses an AI algorithm to tailor workout programs based on user feedback, performance, and goals. They leverage a large community for social motivation, sharing progress, and participating in challenges, which helps boost engagement and retention.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Actiq’s Competitive Edge:</em> Actiq focuses on multimodal AI with real-time feedback, particularly through wearable integrations and vision transformers for form correction. This real-time responsiveness and sport-specific coaching set Actiq apart, especially for athletes and users seeking precise movement analysis rather than just bodyweight HIIT routines.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>WHOOP</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>What They’re Building:</em> WHOOP combines a wearable device with a coaching platform that monitors sleep, recovery, and fitness strain. It’s especially popular among athletes who want a detailed understanding of their recovery and performance metrics, providing insights into optimizing workouts based on rest and strain levels.
<em>How They’re Doing It:</em> WHOOP gathers continuous biometric data from its wearable, such as heart rate variability (HRV) and sleep stages, to deliver personalized recommendations. The app uses these metrics to create a daily &quot;strain&quot; score and guides users on how much exertion they should aim for, based on their recovery status.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Actiq’s Competitive Edge:</em> While WHOOP is strong on recovery and strain insights, Actiq combines these biometric insights with actionable, real-time workout feedback and adaptive goal-setting. Actiq’s focus on multimodal training (combining wearables, visual AI, and community feedback) allows for a comprehensive training ecosystem, not just limited to recovery metrics.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Peloton</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>What They’re Building:</em> Peloton offers a connected fitness platform with live and on-demand workout classes, mainly focusing on cycling, running, and strength training. Their platform emphasizes interactive classes, gamification, and community engagement, with a strong social component through live leaderboards and in-class metrics.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>How They’re Doing It:</em> Peloton’s model combines a high-quality at-home fitness experience with gamified elements and social connectivity. They use live instructors, motivational tracking, and competitive leaderboards to drive user engagement, creating a social fitness experience.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Actiq’s Competitive Edge:</em> While Peloton excels in live classes and social engagement, Actiq’s AI coaches provide personalized, sport-specific training insights that adapt to individual performance in real time. Actiq’s decentralized and community-driven approach (through DAO governance) gives users a voice in app development and training customization, creating a feedback-driven platform that evolves with its user base.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Actiq’s Unique Competitive Moat</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><em>Real-Time Multimodal AI:</em> Actiq’s unique blend of wearable integration, vision transformers, and biometric analysis allows it to deliver actionable, real-time feedback that’s adaptable to different sports and fitness levels.<br />
Decentralized Community Input and DAO Governance: By integrating a DAO, Actiq empowers users to influence app development, AI model adjustments, and training content, creating a community-driven platform that adapts directly to user needs.</li>
<li><em>Comprehensive, Sport-Specific Coaching:</em> Actiq goes beyond general fitness or specific exercises by providing sport-specific insights and real-time movement correction, making it ideal for athletes or users serious about refining their technique.</li>
<li><em>Token-Based Incentives and Gamification:</em> $ACTI tokens incentivize engagement through a gamified ecosystem, allowing Actiq to reward progress, promote community contributions, and enhance long-term retention without oversaturating rewards.</li>

        <span>Are there plans to expand the range of sports or introduce advanced coaching features? If so, are there specific sports or features the team is targeting?</span>
    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>Actiq has step by step plans to expand the range of sports supported on its platform and introduce advanced coaching features. We start with a most popular sports in the markets (tennis and golf) and expands with one&#x27;s which is most significant for specific markets we target, such us cricket for India.</p>
<p><strong>Expansion of Supported Sports:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Endurance Sports.</strong> Actiq plans to introduce more tailored features for endurance-based sports like running, cycling, and swimming. These features may include metrics for pace, cadence, heart rate zones, and recovery tracking to help athletes improve endurance and manage training loads effectively.</li>
<li><strong>Strength and Power Sports.</strong> For users in strength sports like weightlifting, CrossFit, and bodybuilding, Actiq aims to add specialized coaching on form, power output, and muscle engagement. Vision transformers will be leveraged to monitor and correct form in real-time, ensuring safe and effective strength training.</li>
<li><strong>Skill-Based Sports.</strong> Sports with high skill requirements, such as tennis, martial arts, and basketball, are also on Actiq’s radar. Features like real-time swing analysis for tennis, punch/kick tracking for martial arts, and shooting technique for basketball would provide sport-specific guidance to help athletes refine techniques.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advanced Coaching Features in Development</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Real-Time Form and Technique Correction.</strong> Actiq is working on refining its AI to provide even more granular, sport-specific feedback. For example, in tennis, the AI might analyze grip, swing arc, and foot placement. In weightlifting, it could monitor joint angles and movement speed to prevent injuries and optimize performance.</li>
<li><strong>Biomechanics and Motion Analysis.</strong> Advanced motion analysis features are in development, which will break down complex movements into individual components, such as knee alignment, hip rotation, and shoulder stability. This level of detail helps athletes in sports like golf, gymnastics, or sprinting improve their form and efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Goal-Setting and Progression Tracking.</strong> Future updates will include adaptive goal-setting that adjusts based on the user’s recent performance and fatigue levels, providing personalized recommendations to avoid overtraining and encourage gradual progression.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Recovery Metrics.</strong> Actiq plans to incorporate more in-depth recovery tracking, including metrics such as heart rate variability (HRV), sleep analysis, and stress monitoring. These insights help athletes optimize training cycles and reduce injury risk, especially for sports with high physical demands.</li>
